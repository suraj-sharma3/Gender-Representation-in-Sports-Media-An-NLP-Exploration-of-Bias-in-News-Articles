4,"Asian Games: Wushu athlete goes incommunicado, family worried","NEW DELHI: Wushu athlete Mepung Lamgu has gone incommunicado since being denied visa to travel to China for the Asian Games, leaving her family members in Arunachal Pradesh worried and clinging to hope that she wouldn't take any ""extreme step"".The 20-year-old is one of the three wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh who were denied visas to travel to China for the Hangzhou Asian Games.She was ""crying inconsolably"" when her brother Gandhi Lamgu, a doctor in Itanagar, last spoke to her just after the news broke on Thursday. He hasn't been able to contact her since that conversation.""Now she's not even taking our calls, and it's coming switched off. So we are also very worried about her, kahin kuch kar na de ro ro ke (hope she doesn't take any extreme step as she is crying inconsolably),"" Gandhi told PTI from Itanagar.He has not even shared this development with their parents as they would be worried back home in Seppa, a remote place about 200 kilometres from the state capital.""I'm also in a difficult phase of my career, I can't even take leave and I am also not financially sound. So dad would be worried and I have not told them. The phone network coverage is also poor there. I didn't want to disturb them emotionally,"" he lamented.It was Gandhi, who ensured that Mepung pursued her dream in wushu.Mepung, who competes in wushu taolu-taijijian and taijiquan events, along with two other female wushu players from Arunachal Pradesh -- Nyeman Wangsu and Onilu Tega -- were denied accreditation, which also works as visa, for the Asian Games that officially gets underway on Saturday.The trio were scheduled to fly out of India on Friday night with eight other members of the wushu contingent but were forced to stay back without proper clearance as their accreditation could not be downloaded.This was not the first time the Arunachal athletes faced such an issue for an event in China.India had pulled out of the World University Games in Chengdu in July in response to stapled visas being issued to athletes from India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh.""When I spoke to her last she was crying like hell yesterday. Then we had exchanged few words on WhatsApp.""She's really drained emotionally, not talking to anyone in the family. I just told her we can only try. Being an elder brother, I tried my best to make her understand the reality but she's too young.""We are trying our best but we are helpless. I'm sure there will be many more opportunities ahead in future. I just told her this.""This has not happened for the first time. We have been facing the same issue. But our reach is not that far.""Daughter of a police constable, Mepung has six siblings including her eldest brother Gandhi.""When she was in class six, she was really meritorious but she was very keen on becoming a sports person and become a wushu athlete.""So, as a responsible brother, my dad and I decided that she should follow her dream and put her in our renowned sports school Sangeladin Sports School, got enrolled in class six. She has not stopped since then.""Mepung made her first mark as a junior by winning a bronze in the International Wushu Championship in Georgia in 2016.She then went on to win two gold medals in Moscow Wushu Star 2022, and this year she won a bronze in the same meet at Moscow.She also shone at the Gujarat National Games, returning with a gold medal and then visited her hometown in Seppa."
5,Top female para-athletes allege ‘mental harassment' by PCI,"NEW DELHI: India’s two leading women para-athletes, both ranked among World’s top-10 in their respective class, have alleged “mental harassment” and “injustice” at the hands of the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI), and threatened to sit on a protest alongside the agitating wrestlers at Jantar Mantar here.Pooja Yadav (F54 category) and Sakshi Kasana (F55 category) – para-athletes on wheelchair – have petitioned the union sports ministry, highlighting the ills allegedly plaguing the PCI management, following which the Sports Authority of India (SAI) has launched a probe into their allegations.In their complaint, both the para-athletes – also India’s No.1 in their respective categories – have alleged that the PCI sends its preferred set of athletes — without following any selection criteria — and own set of coaches and escorts on a “payment basis”.It’s been learnt that the two had a meeting with SAI Director General (DG), Sandip Pradhan, in his office here, following which an explanation was sought from PCI.“The PCI has asked us to deposit Rs 2.5 lakh (for athlete) and Rs 2.5 lakh (for escort) for taking part in the World Para-Athletics Grand Prix 2023 going to be held in Italy this month. PCI personally prepared the list of athletes (without keeping any trials or selection criterion or any other information) and sent the list to the competition organisers for extending the invitation. The invitation list was prepared by PCI without our names being sent. Upon inquiring, the PCI asked for finances mentioned above to be deposited in the account if we wanted to participate. Even being on top in our categories, we were not selected as we are not financially independent but the para-athletes ranked below us were picked,” the two wrote in their complaint to the office of sports minister Anurag Thakur.“This is mental harassment of para-athletes, be it financially or emotionally. We bring glory to the nation every year but due to these disturbances and nuisances occurring, many are forced to leave para-athletics because of continuous harassment by PCI,” they alleged.While Pooja is national record-holder in javelin, shot-put and discus throw, Sakshi is a national record-holder in discus throw and a gold medallist in javelin at the Nationals. Pooja had recently set a new national record in her events at the 21st National Para-Athletics Championships in Pune in March. “If the government doesn’t listen to us, we will start our own protest alongside the wrestlers at Jantar Mantar to highlight the PCI’s wrongdoings,” the two told this publication.Responding to allegations, the PCI sent a detailed explanation to the minister’s office on Friday, rejecting all the charges.“Sakshi and Pooja are performing well and there is no reason for discrimination or discouragement to them for competing in any championships. As per the guidelines of International Paralympic Committee (IPC), F54 and F55 categories are not allowed dedicated personal escorts and it is only athletes with categories F51, 52 & 53 who can have personal escorts. However, if an athlete desires to take a personal escort, he/she is allowed at his/her own cost... However, the team escorts have always been there with the team and, if they want any assistance, they can take the help of the common escort for the team,” the PCI said in its response.“The complaint of Pooja and Sakshi with regards to deposit of Rs. 2.5 lakh is in view of the above explanation for allowing them to participate in any of the IPC-approved championships of their own choice and requests. Nevertheless, the amount of contribution is for remittance to PCI accounts and not to any personal account in order to support expenses for bearing cost of air travel, boarding and lodging, local transport, accreditation/ entry fee, miscellaneous charges, covid test, capitation fee etc,” the PCI added."

The quality facilities will enable us to develop a large pool of male and female players who we hope will be the future stars of Rajasthan and Indian cricket.”Former Royals’ player Pankaj Singh, who was part of the inaugural IPL-winning Royals’ team, was present during the announcement in Jaipur.The former Indian fast bowler said, “I am pleased to see my first-ever IPL team, the Rajasthan Royals, taking this step to enhance the quality of cricket in the state.

12,"World Athletics set to tighten transgender rules, lift Russia doping ban","PARIS: World Athletics are likely to tighten rules around the participation of transgender women in female competition in a charged meeting of its decision-making body Thursday that should also see the doping ban on Russia lifted.Administrators behind the leading Olympic sport have taken a different approach from that of swimming which has effectively banned transgender athletes from elite female competition.Track and field's global body have said its ""preferred option"" is to tighten the rules surrounding eligibility but that it wants to use limits on testosterone as the key determining factor.It said its preferred option was to amend the regulations covering both transgender athletes and those classified as DSD, in other words having ""differences of sexual development"". The most high-profile DSD athlete is double Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya of South Africa.Under the World Athletics proposals, in order to compete in the female category, transgender and DSD athletes would have to reduce their amount of blood testosterone from the current maximum of five nanomoles per litre to below 2.5, and remain below this level for two years rather than just one, as is the case now.The proposals will be discussed and put to the vote at the meeting of World Athletics' Council that starts Tuesday in Monaco, with any decisions published on Thursday.Another major proposal is that concerning Russian athletes, coming at the moment where global sporting bodies are debating their potential reintegration ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.Russia's track and field federation has been barred since 2015 after a damning World Anti-Doping Agency report identified ""a deeply-rooted culture of doping"". It is not eligible to host World Athletics events or send teams to international championships.For the athletics superpower to return it has to meet a series of strict conditions including establishing a culture of zero tolerance and an effective anti-doping structure.Just a handful of Russian athletes took part in track and field at the Tokyo Olympics, which was postponed from 2020 to 2021 because of the Covid pandemic, and they did so under a neutral flag.A lifting of sanctions over the doping issue would have little immediate effect, however, as all Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from competition ""for the foreseeable future"" since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. That includes the option of competing as a neutral.Just 18 months out from the Olympics in Paris, the sport of athletics' point of view on potential Russian participation will come under increased scrutiny.After having recommended the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian sportspeople 13 months ago, the International Olympic Committee in January said it was seeking a ""pathway"" for Russians to take part in the Games in the French capital.Following that announcement, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) offered athletes from both countries the chance to compete in this year's Asian Games.That was a significant move because they could gain qualifying marks in competition in Asia to allow them to compete in Paris.That prompted a demand for clarification from more than 30 countries including the United States, Canada, Britain, France and Sweden.There seems to be a groundswell towards allowing the return of Russians and Belarusians under a neutral flag, and the Olympic sport of fencing earlier this month decided to allow athletes from those two countries to take part in qualifying events, sparking outrage in Ukraine.The ongoing women's World Boxing Championships in India has also featured fighters from both Russia and Belarus competing under their national flags and anthems.That led to a boycott by countries including the United States, Ukraine, Canada, Sweden and Britain.World Athletics president Sebastian Coe has been unequivocal in his previous declarations on the fall-out from the Ukraine invasion, saying his body would not budge while Kyiv remained under attack."

15,"Setting lofty standards, can India breach the 100-medal mark at Hangzhou Asiad?","NEW DELHI: India has set itself an ambitious target of crossing the 100-medal mark at the Asian Games in Hangzhou. The country has sent a 921-member strong contingent, which includes 655 sportspersons and 260 coaches and support staff and will be participating in 39 sports at the continental event.When the medal rounds begin on Sunday, the sports administrators back home would be hoping that the athletes selected by them return with their best-ever medal show from the Mainland.Indian rowers shine at Asian Games, secure 8 finals including men's lightweight double scullsIn Jakarta five years ago, India had sent 572 athletes to compete in 36 sports and returned with its highest-ever haul of 70 medals, including 16 gold. But, in setting the lofty standards and aiming for the sky, did the sports ministry, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) look at things realistically and objectively. There's no guarantee that naming a biggest-ever contingent can ensure the highest-ever medal haul. India hopes to pocket most of its medals from athletics, shooting, badminton, boxing, wrestling, tennis, rowing, sailing and cricket, besides a good show in squash, taekwondo, judo, wushu and equestrian. But, as things stand, wrestlers, women shuttlers, men pugilists, recurve archers, show-jumping and eventing horse riders and footballers don’t inspire much confidence when we talk about medals. For instance, everyone saw what happened at the senior world wrestling championships in Belgrade, where none of our men and women freestyle – except for Antim Panghal’s bronze – and greco-roman wrestlers could win medals. Similarly, Olympic medallist and former world champion, PV Sindhu, has been experiencing a deep slump in form, while it would be tough for other female shuttlers in the squad to challenge the might of their Chinese, Japanese, Chinese Taipei and South Korean rivals, among others. Talking about men’s boxing, except for Deepak Bhoria (51kg), one can't see any other name climbing up the podium. Same could be said about recurve archers, with archery powerhouses – South Korea and Chinese Taipei – standing between them and medals. The least said about the football team is the better and hammering the Sunil Chettri-led side got at the hands of China in its opening round fixture. The introduction of men’s and women’s cricket at the Games has certainly raised hopes for two gold. Our women’s cricket team is expected to clash with arch-rivals Pakistan in the title clash on Monday, provided the rain doesn't play spoilsport. The men’s, too, are primed to reach the final and face Pakistan on October 7. Athletics has been the happiest hunting ground for India, with as many as 254 medals – 79 gold, 88 silver and 87 bronze – bagged so far. And the medal count is expected to grow further in Hangzhou with Neeraj Chopra, Tajinderpal Singh Toor, Murali Sreeshankar, Jeswin Aldrin, Avinash Sable, men’s 4x400m relay team, Jyothi Yarraji, Shaili Singh, Parul Chaudhary and Swapna Barman among the title contenders. Hangzhou ready for 'Smart' Asian GamesIndian rowers have made a big splash at the Games, sailing into a total of eight finals, while the men’s volleyball team has created history by reaching the quarters on Friday. With chess returning to the Games for the first time since 2010, India would be hoping to bag some more medals. India has won 672 medals at the Games since its inaugural edition in 1951. During the 1951 Asiad, India secured an impressive tally of 51 medals, consisting of 15 gold, which positioned the country in second place overall, trailing only behind Japan, which claimed 60 medals. To this day, the second-place finish remains India’s best performance in the history of the continental event.Xi to attend opening ceremonyChinese President Xi Jinping will attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games on Saturday, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced on Thursday. The ceremony, which begins on Saturday night at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Centre Stadium, will deliver many historic firsts to provide a blueprint for the sustainable and digitally-enhanced future of such gala events, according to the ceremony’s creative team."
16,Good show by AP athletes,"Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh athletes performed well to take fourth position among women and overall 10th in the National athletics championships in Bhubaneswar recently. Yarraji Jyothi put in a splendid show, winning two gold medals and being part of the silver medal winning 4x100M quartet. “This was indeed a splendid show. Apart from the medals they picked up, two golds, one silver and fourth bronze, AP athletes stood fourth to 10th in several other events.” chairman of AP Athletics Association’s selection committee M NarayanaRao said here on Wednesday.Apart from Jyothi’s two gold, in 100M and 100M hurdles, and the team’s 4x100 M relay, other medal winners wereBhavani Yadav Bhagavathi (long jump bronze), Malla Anusha (triple jump bronze), Sowmiya Murugan (heptathlon bronze) and Rashmi K (javelin bronze).Olympic day celebrationsThe Olympic Association of Visakhapatnam will conduct the Olympic day run from the GVMC aqua sports complex to the children’s park on the beach road, from 6 am on June 23 to mark the Olympic day. International medallists would be honoured and two male and two female sportspersons who have won medals in the National championships during this year and two individuals who have rendered service for the promotion of sports in the district, would be honoured. Sportspersons who have participated in the Olympics, Asian, Commonwealth Games, National and international events, Dronacharya, Arjuna award winners would participate in the Run along with students and employees, informed general secretary of the Olympic Association of Visakhapatnam K Suryanarayana."
17,"Once nursery of Sakshi Malik, Rohtak stadium now neglected","ROHTAK: Rohtak’s Chhotu Ram Stadium, which had emerged as a nursery of national and international athletes and even served as the training ground for grappler Sakshi Malik before she became India’s first female to ever win a medal in the Olympics, in 2016, now paints a picture of apathy and neglect. The stadium’s primary ground, where athletes run, has been overrun by wild growth of grass and bushes in the absence of regular maintenance. The lights at the main stadium are lying defunct since long, causing significant inconvenience to the athletes during early morning and late evening practice sessions. On the stadium premises, the newly constructed bathrooms for females and males are frequented by outsiders, who reportedly consume intoxicants there. These bathrooms lack doors and the taps have either been stolen or broken by such unauthorised visitors, who trespass the space with impunity.Even the front side of the stadium has gradually been encroached upon by shopkeepers, leading to a growing pile of garbage near the entrance. The exclusive campus intended for sportspersons and athletes has been repurposed as a parking area for visitors . A visit to the stadium building reveals the disheartening sight of used syringes and drug packets strewn all over, with no one responsible for their removal. Even the basic amenities such as potable water and adequate toilet facilities for players are conspicuously absent, leaving athletes and their parents deeply dissatisfied. Coach Anoop, who is presently overseeing the affairs of district sports department, said they were short of funds to get any major development work done. “But we are making efforts to complete small-budget works in the stadium,” he added."
18,"Govt taking all steps for safety of women athletes, says Sports Minister Anurag Thakur","NEW DELHI: Sports Minister Anurag Thakur on Wednesday said that the government is taking all possible steps to ensure safety of women athletes, hours after the Sports Authority of India (SAI) issued a directive, making it mandatory for NSFs to include women coaches in the teams.""The awareness campaigns about doping and women's safety have been introduced in both Khelo India Youth Games and University Games.""Regarding women's safety measures, we are trying not only to issue guidelines but to pass on these to every sportsperson so that they are not uninformed and they can protect themselves and their dignity,"" Thakur told reporters on the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of six world-standard squash courts at the Major Dhyan Chand stadium here.SAI's decision came close to the heels of two harassment complaints by female athletes against their respective coaches.A female cyclist had recently accused chief coach R K Sharma of ""inappropriate behaviour"" in Slovenia and had also filed an FIR against him. The coach was sacked and is facing a detailed investigation.A female sailor had also complained that her coach made her ""uncomfortable"" during training trip in Germany although she did not term it as sexual harassment.Besides, the NSFs have also been asked to appoint a Compliance Officer (male & female) at all National Coaching Camps and Foreign Exposures."
