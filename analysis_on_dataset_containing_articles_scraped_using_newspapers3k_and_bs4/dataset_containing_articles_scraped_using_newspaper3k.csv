1,Title: New line-up of Louis Theroux interviews announced,"BBC Factual announces six names that meet multi award-winning journalist and broadcaster Louis Theroux for the second series of Louis Theroux Interviews, including cultural icons and industry trailblazers from across the worlds of sport, entertainment and global affairs.

Filmed across a number of locations, from New York City to Normandy, Glastonbury to the French Riviera, the upcoming series will bring viewers closer than ever to some of the world’s most well-known personalities and Louis’s most diverse range of guests yet:

Two-time world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua

Actor and producer, Ashley Walters

Whistleblower and activist, Chelsea Manning

Hollywood icon, Dame Joan Collins

Artist and musician, Pete Doherty

Singer-songwriter, Raye

Combining one-on-one conversations with Louis’ signature immersive filming style, each of the six documentaries explore their subject’s lives and careers up to today, including those at pivotal moments in their careers. From Mindhouse productions, co-founded by Theroux, the second series is expected to air on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer later this year.

Anthony Joshua

Louis comes face to face with two-time world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, at his local boxing gym in North London. Against the backdrop of AJ’s fight with American boxer Jermaine Franklin, Louis explores his success, set-backs and his sporting motivations, as well as spending time together in the Watford estate in which AJ was raised.

Ashley Walters

In the Kent seaside town of Herne Bay, Louis meets Top Boy actor and ex-So Solid Crew rapper Ashley Walters. Ashley tells Louis about growing up in Peckham, including run-ins with the police, his transition from music to acting, and life by the sea with his partner and children.

Chelsea Manning

Louis travels to New York City to delve into the mind of one of America's most polarizing figures, famous whistleblower and activist Chelsea Manning. In 2010, Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst, released the largest set of classified documents in U.S. history and was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison for her actions. Branded a traitor by some and a hero by others, Chelsea reveals what drove her to risk everything by making the documents public, whilst sharing details of her life now as a DJ and public speaker.

Joan Collins

Louis heads to the French Riviera to meet one of the icons of Hollywood’s Golden age, Dame Joan Collins. Welcomed into her holiday home near St Tropez, Louis and Dame Joan discuss the highs and lows of her multi-decade career, including her star turns in The Stud and as Alexis in Dynasty. Louis also hits the town with Dame Joan and her husband of over 20 years, Percy Gibson.

Pete Doherty

Louis meets notorious Libertines and Babyshambles frontman Pete Doherty in Normandy, where he now lives with his wife and their baby daughter. Discussing music, drugs and his hopes for a bright future after a turbulent career, Louis also joins Pete on tour with the rest of the Libertines, and hangs out backstage at Secret Garden Party in Cambridgeshire.

Raye

In South London Louis meets the newly independent singer and songwriter, Raye. In a pivotal year that has seen her winning an Ivor Novello and nominated for a Mercury Music Prize, Louis and Raye unpack her journey from her record label split, to her number one single ‘Escapism’, and a new artistic freedom. Louis also takes to the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury to watch the 25-year-old musician as she marks this new chapter with one of her biggest performances yet.

Louis Theroux says: ""Working with the team on these six new programmes has been an enormous pleasure. The six guests are all distinctive and brilliant in different ways, all of them people who have endured setbacks and huge successes, and who have something to share with the world based on their journeys through life. We have tried to build on the success of the first six Louis Theroux Interviews, while pushing further this time into terrain that is gritty and difficult, exploring subjects like mental health, brushes with the law, and political controversy.

""Like the first six Louis Theroux Interviews, each show mixes stylish master interviews with behind-the-scenes moments and actuality shot on location, so viewers have the double pleasure of a thoughtful in-depth conversation alongside a revealing look into the lives of the contributors: in the locker room post-fight with Anthony Joshua, Raye's dressing room before her Glastonbury set, Joan Collins' house in the south of France. The tone of the shows is always open-minded and generous-hearted, while hopefully being funny, and always mindful of the need to keep viewers interested. I like them, and I'm notoriously hard to please.""

Clare Sillery, BBC Head of Commissioning, Documentaries, says: ""I am delighted that Louis is back with such an exciting and eclectic mix of new interviewees. Louis’s genuine curiosity and warmth mean that each of these meetings will bring us something very new and different and I can’t wait to see him take us deeper into the worlds of these hugely engaging cultural figures.""

The first series saw Louis up close and personal with some of the UK’s biggest stars: Stormzy; Dame Judi Dench; Yungblud; Bear Grylls; Katherine Ryan; and Rita Ora, with an average audience of more than 2.1m tuning in* (*Consolidated viewing figures for the first four episodes) in the first 7 days.

Louis Theroux Interviews, a 6x45’ series from Mindhouse Productions for BBC Two and iPlayer, was commissioned by Clare Sillery, Head of Commissioning, Documentaries. The Executive Producers are Arron Fellows and Emma Whitehead. The Series Producer is Alex Kohler and the Production Executive is Suzy Burnet. The Commissioning Editors are Max Gogarty and Fran Baker. Global sales will be handled by BBC Studios Distribution.

2,"Title: Strictly Come Dancing 2023 Judges celebrate series 21 and explain why ""sending somebody home is never easy""","L-R: Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas, Motsi Mabuse and Anton du Beke (Image: BBC/Ray Burmiston)

Saturday nights are even more fab-u-lous thanks to the 21st series of the multi-award-winning Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, once again bringing plenty of glitz and glamour to homes across the nation. As the Judges return to put our celebrity contestants to the test, we caught up with Shirley Ballas, Anton Du Beke, Motsi Mabuse and Craig Revel Horwood to find out about what they were up to in their 21st year, their go-to dance songs at parties and weddings, and what they're most looking forward to from Strictly 2023. Strictly Come Dancing goes live from Saturday 23 September at 6.15pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer SH3 Shirley Ballas

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? I’m super excited to return to the panel, it’s going to be one superb series. I feel so lucky to get a front row seat in the ballroom, it is a real privilege. I cannot wait to nurture and guide our new celebrities to help them become the best dancers they can be. We've asked all the Pro’s what they were doing when they were 21, what were you doing when you were 21? And what was life like for you? When I was 21 I was married to my dance partner. We were aiming to be world champions and we were dancing professionally and lecturing all over the world. Every year there is so much excitement when Strictly comes back on our screens, what keeps audiences coming back for more? I think the injection of glitz and glamour lightens up audiences' living rooms. I think viewers love to follow the journey of our celebrities throughout their time on the show and they enjoy having their own opinions and thoughts on the dances. What is the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly judge, and the biggest challenge? The biggest joy is being a small part in the nations favourite show and sharing my knowledge and passion for dance. The biggest challenge is when I hear Anton vote differently to Craig and Motsi in the dance off and then the final say is down to me. It’s so heartbreaking having to send anyone home. If you could only dance one kind of dance style for the rest of your life what would it be and why? I think it has to be the Rumba, as it’s the dance of love. It's fast, slow, sharp and soft – it’s got everything in there and it’s such a passionate dance. Do you have one stand-out dance and/or celebrity dancer from last year’s Strictly Come Dancing? It has got to be Hamza’s Salsa, what a surprise! The way he was flipping and throwing Jowita around like there’s no tomorrow, it was so impressive. I think that moment will go down in Strictly history. If you could only pick one favourite performance from all your series so far, what would it be, and why? I think it would have to be Kelvin Fletcher’s Samba with Oti in Week One in 2019. I really don’t know how it could be topped! He has this big smile on his face and his bright blue shirt. It was absolutely outstanding and also technically astonishing – definitely one to remember. Strictly returned to Blackpool last year, after some time away, how was that, and does it make you excited to return this year? It was amazing to return to Blackpool, the ballroom there is an iconic venue that holds a very special place in my heart. Being in Blackpool takes everything to a whole new level, it’s the home of ballroom dancing and the walls are steeped in history. We have 19 brilliant Pro’s for this series, how would you sum up their contribution towards the show making it what it is? It’s really simple, we wouldn’t have a show without the marvellous professional dancers. They put their all into it and work so hard to bring out the best in their celebrity partners. They dedicate so much of their craft to the show and it pays off each and every series when we see the level of dancing improve. They are such a joy to watch. Is there a song that will never fail to get you on the dancefloor at parties or weddings? It has to be I'm Still Standing by Elton John. I just can’t resist a Jive when I hear that song! Finally is there anything you are particularly excited for this series? To be back with my beautiful Judges and for all the laughs and smiles. I’m also really looking forward to fangirling over Angela Rippon! She announced me during the UK championships many times during my competitive career so her voice brings back so many fond memories. Anton Du Beke

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? I tell you what, I am naturally, brilliantly excited about the whole thing, I can't wait. For me it's just a magical time of year when Strictly returns to our screens. It always starts in the summer and goes into the autumn and winter. It's just brilliant. The excitement about Strictly Come Dancing coming back with all the celebrities and just being in the building with everybody milling around, delighted and happy and joyous and all the brilliant teams back together. It's so wonderfully exciting. We’ve asked all the Pro’s what they were doing when they were 21 What were you doing when you were 21? I would have been dancing, competing, practising and flying about trying to get better, that was my life really. I have literally been dancing every day of my life and also at 21, I think I was working in a bakery. I would have started work at the bakery at three o'clock in the morning, and then dancing at night and competing at weekends. Baker by day, dancer by night! There's so much excitement when Strictly comes back. What do you think keeps audiences coming back from? It's so multi layered and, I don't want to repeat myself too much, but it is just brilliant because there's so much about it you can love. Firstly, it's the best of the best, there is so much on the show you can enjoy. Obviously you will want to know who the celebrities are, some you'll know and some you won't know as well, and audiences will get a favourite immediately so that's always exciting in the first show. The music's amazing, the Judges are brilliant, Tess and Claudia are incredible, the frocks are fantastic, then you have all of sets and the lighting! The show is so multi-generational as well. What is the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly Judging and what's the biggest challenge? The biggest joy is being part of it and turning up every week. It's a real surprise and a fortune that I've been a part of the show since the beginning, and there’s only Craig, Tess and I left from the very first series and to have been part of a show that is part of the fabric of British consciousness – and the world’s, it’s such a global show - is sort of overwhelming, if I think about it too deeply it blows my mind. To be a part of that since the beginning, I feel massive pride. I love it now as much as I did then and I'm delighted about that as well. What is the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly judge, and the biggest challenge? The biggest challenge is eliminating somebody and sometimes it’s tighter than you'd want it to be, but that's the job and that's what I’m there for, so that is the most challenging part. Trying to be encouraging, trying to help people - that's the fun part. If you could only dance one kind of dance style for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? Probably a ballroom dance of some sort I’d imagine, taking a lady into my arms and dancing together. However, if I could do one thing more now, I’d like to become a better tap dancer because I don’t tap as well as I’d like, and I’d like that skill. Do you have one standout dance or celebrity dancer from last year’s Strictly? Helen and Gorka’s couples choice dance to Mein Herr and Hamza did some numbers that were staggering, but for pure dancing and precision Helen’s was the standout moment from last year for me. Strictly returned to Blackpool last year after some time away, how was it, and does it make you excited to return this year? Oh wasn't it brilliant?! It's such a massive production and we all go up to Blackpool and then rig it all up and it takes ten days, I mean it’s a huge thing, but it's so worth it! It's a wonderful moment in the series as well, but it means so much more than just going to Blackpool, we're going for the tower ballroom which is such an iconic venue. We’ve got 19 brilliant Pro’s this series, how would you sum up their contribution in making the show what it is? Oh epic, the Pro’s make it what it is, I've always felt this really. They're the ones to put the content for the show on the floor, they perform the group dances, they choreograph their celebrity routines, and they work with the celebrities to get the best out of them. The Pro’s are extraordinary talents and remarkable performers. Is there a song that will never fail to get you on the dance floor at weddings and parties? Dancing Queen by ABBA. Finally, is there anything you're particularly excited about for this series of Strictly Come Dancing? Just all of the above, although I am really excited about the Judges number at the beginning. What I would love to do one year, is to do a dance with one of the professionals for one of the artist numbers like I used to. There’s nothing quite like performing, it’s magical, the thing about dancing with a celebrity is you get voted off, and that’s the bit I hated! Motsi Mabuse

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? It feels amazing, and I'm super excited to meet everyone and to see how this season will develop. We've asked all the Pro’s what they were doing when they were 21, what were you doing when you were 21? And what was life like for you? I had been in Europe for three years and was dancing, minding my own business. Just dancing, my life was dancing. I was dancing in Germany and preparing for a championship. Nothing else, eat, dance and sleep, that’s it. Every year there's so much excitement when Strictly comes back on our screens. What keeps audiences coming back for more? The audiences love the dances and they love the show, it's a beautiful, emotional show, full of glitz and glamour and we all get to share it together. It's just such a special time of the year when Strictly starts. What's the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly Judge and what's the biggest challenge? The biggest joy is being part of such a professional and wonderful team that is huge and everybody's giving 110% and that that to me is quite inspiring. I think the biggest challenge for me is always the dance off because I bond with all the contestants and sending somebody home is never easy. If you could only dance one kind of dance style for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? Probably the Rumba because that means I get to dance with my husband all my life. Do you have one standout dance and or celebrity dancer from last years’ Strictly? I think the Salsa from Hamza and Jowita will remain unforgettable. If you could only pick one favourite performance from all your series so far, what would it be? It would be the week one Samba from Kelvin and Oti because he wasn't meant to be on the show. Jamie Laing had broken his leg and then Oti got Kelvin and no one could have planned anything like that, and he comes on the floor and they just burned the floor. It was absolutely amazing! Strictly returned to Blackpool last year after some time away, how was that and does it make you excited to return this year? It was fantastic being back in Blackpool because I also felt like everybody had their game on and I just can't wait to be back in in the tower ballroom for this new series. We have 19 brilliant Pro’s for this series, how would you sum up their contribution towards making the show what it is? Well, the show wouldn't be what it is without the Pro dancers, it's quite simple. It wouldn't be what it is without the dancers. They're such a big part of the show, they are the other half of a couple, so they are very, very important. Is there a song that will never fail to get you on the dance floor at parties or weddings? You Are The First, The Last, My Everything by Barry White And finally, is there anything you're particularly excited about for this series? I'm particularly excited about all the stories we're going to hear, I believe in the power of personality, there are brand new celebrities so I just want to see their personalities on the floor. Craig Revel Horwood

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? It’s like coming home for me. Every year, for the last 20 years, I have been coming home to Strictly and this is no different. I think even better because the line-up for this series is absolutely phenomenal. We have asked all the pros what they were doing when they were 21. What were you doing when you were 21? I had my 21st birthday in my hometown of Ballarat, Australia as I hired a bus to take the cast of Me and My Girl, a show I was in at the time there, and had a fantastic time. I remember my 21st so well, because it was just incredible set in a haystack and very Australian and very non-theatrical even though it was full of lots of theatre people. It was a blazing hot day as well and everyone got burned, 21 was a great year for me in the theatre. Every year, there's so much excitement when strictly comes back. What keeps audiences coming back for more? I think it's a programme that they can rely on. They know it's the lead up to Christmas and it's something they know, something they love and it's something they feel a part of. I think it embraces everybody and it has won the hearts and minds of not only this nation but so many. So there's something going right with it. I think it makes you feel like a part of the community which I think is great. What is the biggest joy you take from your job and what's the biggest challenge? The biggest joy I take from my job is getting front row seats to the best dance show in the world and the biggest challenge I think for me is making the right decisions when we're letting someone go. I think that's the hardest thing for me in the job. If you could only dance one kind of dance style the rest of your life, what would it be and why? A Charleston because that's my speciality, and it's completely different. It's such hard work and will keep me thin for the rest of my life. Anyone can do it and it doesn't matter how old you are, you can still get a bit of swivel in there! Do you have one standout dance or celebrity dancer from last year Strictly? I loved Fleur in Blackpool, she was amazing, this is when Fleur came into her own, I just loved it. She was right at home and rocking it and I got out my 10 paddle for the first time, which was great. If you could only pick one favourite performance for all your series what would it be? I think Anton Du Beke dancing with Ann Widdecombe, where he did the aeroplane move I just went ‘I cannot believe this is actually happening in front of my very eyes’ and that will stay with me until my death for all the wrong reasons, but every reason that that tells you what Strictly it's about. I think one of the best dances I've seen was Rose and Giovanni, I thought that was just amazing. Strictly returned to Blackpool last year after some time away, how was that? Does it make you excited to return this year? Yes, I really loved Blackpool! I filmed a couple of programmes up there over the summer and it was absolutely fantastic because I never get to go there in the summer. The audiences are great and the venue is bigger and I think that's exciting. And of course it has that wonderful sprung floor, so it's always great. We have 19 brilliant Pro’s the series, how would you sum up their contribution towards making the show what it is? Well, they really make the show. They are the teachers, they're the nurturers, they're the embracers, they're the ones that pick up the pieces after the Judges have judged them, they have to be all sorts of different things apart from just teachers, and they also have to be there to support, so they work really, really hard. They're the first ones in the last ones out and they're just amazing. Is there one song that will never fail to get you on the dance floor at parties or wedding? I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor. It's disco, It’s my era darling and love it. Finally, is there anything you're particularly excited about? This series, I'm really looking forward to see all the group numbers because I love those and I never get to see those until the day. Normally, I get to see them rehearse and all of that but that's what I look forward to the most.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
3,Title: How did tea become the nation's favourite drink?,"Tea may have some complicated connotations, but one of its strengths is its association with comfort and support in difficult or traumatic situations.

The taste and smell of tea tell us that we're safe before we're even consciously aware.

Clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Andrea Shortland explains that the 'tea and sympathy' tradition ""automatically cues your brain to think 'I'm okay, I'm safe now.'"" Furthermore, the offer of a cup of tea signifies ""perceived social support"" and the space to ""tell your story"", both factors that might even prevent PTSD further down the line. ""The taste and smell get to our safety centre in our brain and tell us we're safe before we're even consciously aware,"" says Andrea.

Studies even suggest that if someone is drinking a hot drink they are much more likely to rate another person more favourably and even offer to help them in some way. ""The idea of warmth,"" explains Andrea, “actually connects when we're physically warm as well as emotionally warm – they're processed in the same part of the brain.""

The PG Tips ads reinforced tea as part of the British psyche

The wildly successful ad series that used a family of anthropomorphised chimpanzees to sell PG Tips tea ran from 1956 to 2003. A copywriter hired to raise the profile of the brand hit upon the idea after walking through London Zoo and seeing a 'Chimps Tea Party', where the chimpanzees were dressed in human clothes while they played with a tea set.

Within 18 months of the campaign starting, PG Tips had jumped from fourth in the market to brand leader. ""It went on to stay brand leader for the next 40 years,"" says ad consultant and author Paul Feldwick, who worked on the PG Tips account in the 1990s, ""and it still vies for that position today.""

The ad was an example of getting an audience to identify with a brand rather than saying why it was better than its competitors. The public did eventually become uncomfortable with how the chimps were used (coinciding with an increasing difficulty in finding a suitable troupe), but the chimps' antics – such as moving pianos, racing in the Tour de France or echoing stories in the news such as the oil crisis of 1973 and the Channel Tunnel dig in 1992 – were an undeniable hit in the bygone days when mass market advertising worked, and they did their bit to reinforce tea as a staple of our culture.

The world is awash with tea

The tea market is a lot more varied than it was when PG Tips started out. For one thing there is the growth in the herbal tea market, non-caffeinated infusions such as chamomile and peppermint teas. This sector is predicted to sell £345.5 million worth of products in the UK this year.

Meanwhile, tea continues to re-invent itself across the globe. In the US, 85% of all tea consumed is iced tea, and in the Far East there is Bubble Tea from Taiwan (making it big in the UK too) which is sweet milky tea with balls of tapioca in it. Then there's Hong Kong milk tea, which uses super sweet condensed milk. This tea has even lent its name to a virtual pro-democracy movement – the Milk Tea Alliance – across Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand. Tea and politics, it seems, is as ingrained as tea and sympathy!

4,Title: Teenager making flags of the world out of Rubik's Cubes,"A teenager from north London is creating the flags of the world using Rubik’s Cubes in memory of her uncle, who died of a brain tumour.

Mimi's hobby is solving Rubik’s Cubes, which she says she can do in 26 seconds, so it made sense to give the flag challenge a go.

A proposed anti-gay bill in Kenya wants gays and lesbians jailed for 50 years for non-consensual sex.

Dubbed the Family Protection Bill 2023, the draft law sponsored by Homa Bay Town legislator Peter Kaluma, is recommending a ban on homosexuality, same-sex unions and any LGBTQ activities and campaigns.

It also seeks to prohibit gay parades, assemblies and marches on streets, and cross-dressing in public.

“A person who engages in sexual act with a person of the same sex without the consent of the other person shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years and not exceeding 50 years,” says the bill.

Owners of premises used for same-sex relations will pay a fine of $14,000 (£11,000) or face a jail term of seven years if the bill goes through.

Last week, clerics and some civil society organisation groups held anti-LGBTQ protests in the coastal city of Mombasa.

This followed a re-enforcement by Kenya’s Supreme Court of a decision in mid-September to allow the registration of LGBTQ non-governmental organisations.

Kenya’s NGO Coordinating Board had declined to register the National Gay and Lesbian Rights Commission, saying it “promotes same-sex behaviour”, dragging the case for a decade.

The Supreme Court early this year deemed the move discriminatory and unconstitutional hence allowing LGBTQ organisations to register in a landmark ruling.",2023-09-12,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
6,Title: Nine things we learned from Adrian Edmondson's Desert Island Discs,"5. Shakespeare saved him from being kicked out of school

""There wasn't a drama department,” explains Adrian, talking about his boarding school, “but there was a school play and I was in every school play.”

I was going to be expelled but that was when they realised that we were halfway through Hamlet and I was Hamlet

In sixth form he was cast to play Hamlet but in the middle of rehearsals he ran away from school.

“Well, I only ran away because I was going to be expelled for the crime of throwing up in the prefects’ wastepaper bin and the headmaster got me in.”

“I was wearing two pairs of pants as usual for the usual flogging, but he didn't want to flog me this time. He said he was going to suspend me and they were thinking of expelling me.”

“So I did the only sensible thing and ran away. Eventually I ran out of money and gave myself in and I was going to be expelled. But that was when they realised that we were halfway through Hamlet and I was Hamlet.”

“And Hamlet was going to be difficult without Hamlet.”

“So they let me back in on the promise that I joined the army when I left school. I didn’t! That didn’t happen,” laughs Adrian.

6. Samuel Beckett and Brentford Nylons played key roles in his student shows

Adrian met Rik Mayall at Manchester University, and immediately found they shared many common interests: “We both thought Laurel and Hardy were the best of comedy. The other thing we shared was our love of [the Samuel Beckett play] Waiting for Godot. We were the only people who thought it was a funny play.”

Adrian and Rik began performing together, and the university drama department gave them a stage:

“We had the Stephen Joseph Studio, a little German church in the middle of the campus [named after the English stage director who pioneered theatre in the round], and we were allowed to do whatever we liked in it. Every Monday night was studio night and the rest of the department turned up [so] you'd have a guaranteed 100 in the audience and you would do your stuff.”

“I remember we bought a pair of pink duvet covers from Brentford Nylons,” says Adrian of one his and Rik’s productions, “And we were going to string them up from the studio roof and pretend to be God's testicles and talk about the world. Very sort of Waiting for Godot, really.”

7. A cigarette carton played a vital role in his relationship with Jennifer Saunders

Following university Adrian and Rik started appearing at The Comedy Store in London, as part of a growing new comedy scene.

“We were with a group of friends and it all felt very dynamic. You know, Dawn [French] and Jennifer [Saunders] came in, it was Pete [Richardson] and it was Alexei [Sayle]. It was a big family unit,” says Adrian.

The group went on to found their own comedy venue, The Comic Strip, so called because it shared premises with a strip club.

Adrian went on to marry fellow comedian Jennifer Saunders - but it took them a while after they first met to get together.

“Although I think it was love at first sight, we were both in other relationships which failed at different times so there was a kind of overlapping of relationships until we were finally separate people at the same time.”

“Eventually I remember going out to my car and there was a cigarette carton under the windscreen wiper and on it, it said, ‘I love you, love Jennifer’.”

“And that was the first time I knew.”

8. He remembers Rik Mayall with laughter and tears

After years of performing together, Adrian and Rik went their separate ways in 2003 and it wasn’t an easy split: Adrian felt they had done their best work together and, as he puts it: “I thought we'd gone over the top of the mountain. It would become increasingly sadder, and not in a funny way.” But Rik wanted to carry on and continued to put the idea of teaming up again to Adrian, who recalls:

“I hit upon the idea: ‘All right, let's write a couple of episodes of a new series, hand it in, they'll [the TV commissioners] say ‘No’, and then it's not my fault anymore.”

But then the series was commissioned - but they couldn’t complete it. Rik died in 2014 at the age of 56.

“I think of the writing room all the time,” says Adrian when he remembers Rik. “We spent more time in the writing room than anywhere else.”

“And I remember just laughing like drains.”

“His mum... his mum wrote me a lovely letter. I wrote to her after he died and she wrote back, saying all she could remember was us - she could see us out in the garden, a couple of deck chairs just laughing and laughing and laughing - and she could never tell what was quite so funny.”

“It was funny. It was good fun,” says a tearful Adrian of his memories of Rik.

9. His final disc reminds him of family harmony

7,Title: Five unbelievable ways longevity pioneers are trying to live forever,"1. Stitching old and young mice together

Yes, this one’s as gruesome as it sounds. Scientists Mike and Irina Conboy wanted to understand the role blood plays in how tissues age. So, to see what would happen to an old mouse when it received young blood, they stitched pairs of mice together. Mike explains, “as that tissue heals and blood vessels reform… now you have blood slowly trickling from one animal to the other.”

The results were compelling. The old mice became stronger and mentally sharper, and markers of age were reversed. Although the sample size was small, the Conboys’ findings were notable enough to be published in the peer reviewed journals Science and Nature in 2005, and they’ve influenced the longevity community ever since.

2. Getting injected with young blood plasma

Inspired by the Conboys and the research that followed, tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson has tried something pretty shocking: being injected with a young person’s blood plasma. To make sure he was getting plasma from a healthy donor, Bryan asked his then 17-year-old son to help him out. He tells Aleks, “I never imagined that my little baby would grow up and I'd be doing this procedure with him.” And it didn’t stop there: Bryan donated plasma to his dad too.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No

A proposed anti-gay bill in Kenya wants gays and lesbians jailed for 50 years for non-consensual sex.

Migrants make up about 10% of those known to have died when floods hit Libya a week ago, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has told BBC News.

Libya is hugely popular with migrants. According to data from the IOM, which is a United Nations body, more than 706,000 migrants lived in the North African country in February 2023.

Some live and work in Libya long-term, while others use it as a transit point in bids to reach Europe.

Four-hundred migrants are registered as having died in the floods, the IOM understands, although it says that this death toll is likely to change as bodies continue to be recovered.

The IOM and World Health Organization have the wider confirmed death toll at 3,900. However, officials using different methodologies have given widely varying statistics, for example, the mayor of Libyan city Derna estimates more than 20,000 people died.

Derna was, by far, hit hardest by the floods. Two dams burst amid heavy rains and swathes of the city were submerged in water.

14,Title: Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate homeland in India?,"Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate homeland in India? Published 23 hours ago

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Pro-Khalistan supporters protesting in front of the Indian Consulate in Toronto in July

Diplomatic tensions over calls for a separate homeland for Sikhs in India have escalated, after Canada said it was looking at ""credible allegations potentially linking"" the Indian state to the murder of a separatist leader in British Columbia.

India has denied the allegations, describing them as ""absurd"".

For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here's an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:

Who are Sikhs and where do they live?

Sikhism is one of the world's major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan - which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.

There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group.

The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.

Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country's population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000.

Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate nation?

The Khalistan movement calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.

The movement was at its peak in the 1980s in the Indian state of Punjab, when the area experienced a series of violent attacks and thousands of deaths.

It lost steam after Indian armed forces ran special operations against the movement.

Politics in modern Punjab have shifted away from the movement and calls for independence are not a majority position, according to Prof Shruti Kapila from the University of Cambridge.

But supporters in the Sikh diaspora have continued to advocate for a separate state, with calls for independence intensifying in recent years.

Why is Khalistan so sensitive for the Indian government?

India has strongly opposed the Khalistan movement. All mainstream political parties, including in Punjab, have denounced violence and separatism.

The long-running tensions were the cause of two of the most controversial incidents in modern Indian history - the storming of the Golden Temple and the assassination of Indira Gandhi.

In June 1984, the Indian military stormed the holiest site for Sikhs and flushed out militant separatists sheltering in the temple complex in the city of Amritsar.

The assault, which resulted in many deaths and significant damage to the Golden Temple, had been ordered by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

A few months after the operation, Gandhi was killed by two of her Sikh bodyguards, which led to four days of rioting and communal violence.

Thousands of people were killed, most of whom were Sikhs. Estimates range from around 3,000 dead to as many as 17,000.

Khalistan is a red line for India because the scars of the violence in the 1980s are still fresh.

All political parties in India are united in their opposition to Sikh independence, so no Indian government can afford to overlook the Khalistan issue in the interest of bilateral diplomatic relations.

Who was Hardeep Singh Nijjar?

Hardeep Singh Nijjar was a Canadian citizen shot dead outside a Sikh temple on 18 June in Canada, at the age of 45.

He was born in Bharsinghpur village in Punjab's Jalandhar, and moved to Canada in 1997.

First he worked as a plumber, and later became a prominent Sikh leader in the western Canadian province of British Columbia.

India designated him a terrorist in 2020, for his alleged links to Khalistan Tiger Force - a group campaigning for independent Khalistan in the Punjab region of India.

His supporters called these accusations ""unfounded"" and said that he had been the target of threats in the past because of his activism.

Reports in the Indian media say he was working on organising an unofficial referendum in India for an independent Sikh state at the time of his death.

Mr Nijjar is the third prominent Sikh figure to have died unexpectedly in recent months.

How does India put pressure on diaspora Sikhs?

The backdrop to the diplomatic tensions is the growing pressure India has put on governments of three countries with sizeable Sikh populations: Canada, Australia and the UK.

India's government has openly said that a failure to tackle what it calls ""Sikh extremism"" would be an obstacle to good relations.

Australian officials said they would look into vandalism of Hindu temples by pro-Khalistan activists, but would not stop Australian Sikhs expressing their views on an independent homeland.

Canada has come in for Delhi's most open criticism for what it sees as a failure to oppose the pro-Khalistan movement there. While PM Justin Trudeau has said he will stop the ongoing violence, he has also pushed back against ""foreign interference"".

In the UK context, a row kicked off in March after protests outside the Indian High Commission in London, which saw crowds wave yellow ""Khalistan"" banners and a man detach the Indian flag from the first-floor balcony of the building.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No

17,Title: What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?,"What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Published 1 hour ago

Image source, Getty Images

PM Rishi Sunak is expected to announce plans to weaken some of the government's green commitments.

This could include delaying a ban on the sales of new petrol and diesel cars as well as plans to phase out gas boilers.

The UK has already been criticised for falling behind in its efforts to reach ""net zero"" by 2050, a key international target intended to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

What does 'net zero' mean?

Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill.

These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.

Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries - including the UK - agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100.

To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.

However, the UN wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called ""the growing climate disaster"".

Would net zero mean a complete end to greenhouse gas emissions?

Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as ""offsetting"".

Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.

One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.

Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.

So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.

Image source, AlexAntonelliRBGKew Image caption, Trees can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere

What has the UK pledged to do?

To help reach net zero by 2050, the UK has made a series of ambitious pledges including:

The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards net zero by 2050.

What has Rishi Sunak said about the government's net zero plans?

Multiple sources have told the BBC that the prime minister will shortly announce that some of these commitments will be watered down.

Responding to the reported plans, Mr Sunak said the government was committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but in a ""more proportionate way"".

When the government released its updated net zero strategy in March, many climate experts criticised the lack of significant new policies or extra investment.

What will net zero mean for individuals?

While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.

This could include:

Image source, Alamy Image caption, A government scheme to encourage households to install heat pumps has been criticised for poor take-up

What have other countries promised?

Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.

The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies.

The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.

India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.

What is the problem with net zero targets?

There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.

For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself.

But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.

There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
18,Title: How community maps can protect children from extreme heat,"Publication Date: 2023-09-18 00:00:00

On a hot evening in August, when temperatures in Irving, a suburb in Dallas, Texas, can reach a stifling 45C (113F), outdoor pursuits and an active lifestyle can often be challenging for Christina and Landon Howard and their two young children, aged nine and 10.

""We can't go swimming or take part in other daily outdoor activities because it's just too hot outside,"" says Christina.""Our son had to came back indoors the other day after 10 minutes of skateboarding because he felt exhausted by the extreme heat conditions.""

Children are at higher risk of being hospitalised during heatwaves when temperatures exceed 29C (84F), a study on heat and children's visits to emergency departments in New York City found. Children aged 0 to four were the most vulnerable, followed by children aged 13 to 18 and five to 12.

Texan homes generally have in-built AC systems, but with little respite outdoors in the city heat, the increase in energy demand is an economic factor that the Howards are also finding burdensome.

""We're expecting to pay almost $1,000 (£787) for next month's electricity bill. This is already very alarming,"" says Landon.""There's a higher potential of having to fork out money for costly AC repairs that are going to be even more difficult for us to pay.""

Christina and Landon have decided to take matters into her own hands. In August 2023,they started volunteering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) urban heat island mapping campaign after hearing of the scheme through a volunteer callout from the City of Dallas. The initiative collects hyperlocal data to understand vulnerabilities to heat exposure. For several years, Christina and Landon have also been part of a climate change focus group in Texas, helping to make this hidden heat crisis more visible.

""We have always been interested in how climate change will affect our lives and the world, even before recycling was a thing in Texas!"" says Christina.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
19,Title: Business in Russia: Why some firms haven't left,"Publication Date: 2023-09-18 00:00:00

When the first airstrikes fell on Ukraine in February 2022, corporate executives with operations or holdings in Russia were forced to pick a side. This decision had significant implications. Russia remains a major business market, with a population of 145 million; its 2022 GDP was a staggering $2.24tn (£1.81tn), right behind France. Fleeing companies would leave a lot of revenue on the table.

Yet amid a gruelling war, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and widespread international condemnation of Russia, companies risked severe reputational damage by staying put. Plus, a mix of international pressure, sanctions and risks of Russian government interference offered strong reasons for companies to leave when the conflict began.

""Some decided to stay, some decided to go very quickly, and some dragged their feet,"" says Roman Sidortsov, an associate professor of energy policy at Michigan Technological University, US, who practised corporate law and taught in Russia.

One of the biggest companies to pull out almost immediately was British Petroleum, which exited just three days after the conflict began. By 1 March, BMW also announced it would halt Russian production and imports. And after first announcing a plan to leave Russia in March 2022, Heineken sold off its Russian business to Russian packaging firm Arnest for a single euro this August, taking a €300m ($319m; £257m) loss on the division.

Experts disagree on exactly how many companies have left Russia – and what constitutes a 'full departure'. The Kyiv School of Economics Institute, which tracks the status of foreign companies selling or operating in Russia through its Leave Russia project, estimates around 300 have left.

According to a similar list compiled by the Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI), roughly a thousand companies have exited.

However, hundreds of foreign companies continue to operate in, or sell to, Russia. The KSE Institute claims 1,400 companies are still conducting business in some form within the country; by the CELI’s count, around 500 companies are doing so.

A recognisable name on the KSE list is PepsiCo. In early September, Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention accused the multinational soft-drink giant of continuing to produce food products in Russia despite it discontinuing Pepsi-Cola, 7Up and Miranda production.

Tech and finance giants, including Chinese firm Alibaba, also continue to conduct business there, as does British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. Airlines including Emirates, China Eastern and Air Serbia still openly advertise flights to Russia on their websites. Other businesses, like Indian refiner Chennai Petroleum, are gearing up instead of exiting: the company is expanding its services to Russia because of the invasion.

Critics of companies that have remained in Russia, including Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute founder Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, denounce these businesses as greedy, or even complicit in Russia's invasion. But ceasing operations in a country with such major business implications isn't simple. Some businesses remain because of a lack of pressure on them to leave, or due to an existential threat. Others believe staying is the most humane option for their consumers.",2023-09-12,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No

London has been home for England's monarchs for more than 1,000 years – and while the British capital has changed significantly over the last centuries, it remains rich with historic royal sites, from palaces and parks to museums and churches. Where should a visitor begin?

That was soon followed by George Michael's Freedom '90 video – directed by David Fincher and starring the same five women – a cultural touchstone still reverberating decades later. It was such a hit – played in heavy rotation on the then-dominant MTV – that in March 1991 Gianni Versace sent four of the models down the runway to its soundtrack.

22,Title: How I rewired my brain in six weeks,"Publication Date: 2023-09-12 00:00:00

Our brain has an incredible ability to adapt, learn and grow because by its nature, it is plastic – that is, it changes. This is called neuroplasticity, which simply means the brain's ability to adapt and evolve over time in structure and function. It was once thought to be limited to youth but we now know it's a constant force in shaping who we are. Every time we learn a new skill, our brain adapts.

Neuroscientists and psychologists are now finding that we have the power to control that to some extent. And there's good reason to want to boost our brain – an increasing number of studies suggest it can play a role in delaying or preventing degenerative brain diseases.

So, with the help of Thorsten Barnhofer, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Surrey in the UK, that's what I set out to do. He's currently running a study on the effects of mindfulness in managing stress and difficult emotions, with a special focus on individuals with severe depression.

I was surprised that something as simple as mindfulness can play such a crucial role in keeping our minds healthy. Research has shown that mindfulness is a simple but powerful way to enhance several cognitive functions. It can improve attention, relieve pain and reduce stress. Research has found that after only a few months of mindfulness training, certain depression and anxiety symptoms can ease – though as with any complex mental health problem, this may of course vary depending on individual circumstances.

There's more to it. Mindfulness can change the brain. That's because when the stress hormone cortisol increases and remains high, ""it can become toxic for your brain"", says Barnhofer. Stress can also directly inhibit neuroplasticity, so managing it allows the brain to remain more plastic.

The question is, would this work in my brain? Over six weeks, Barnhofer modified a mindfulness research course for me to try out. For 30 minutes a day, either as one single session or two 15-minute sessions, I practiced a guided mindfulness meditation by listening to a recording. In addition, I had one weekly meditation session with Barnhofer, who guided me over Zoom. The full mindfulness course can be accessed online for free.

My instructions were to be as aware as possible to the present moment – and pay attention to things I might usually ignore, such as where my thoughts go, and what occupies my mind from moment to moment. He also encouraged me to be more mindful in daily life – say when cooking or running, to really focus on the moment, bringing my mind back to what I was doing, as well as noticing how often it wanders.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No

When Yasmin Purnell started blogging in 2017, she planned to share her experiences of becoming a digital nomad. However, the creative-writing graduate and copywriter soon found visitors to her site were more interested in how she afforded her freelance lifestyle.

Noticing the hunger for personal finance advice, UK-based Purnell, now 31, rebranded her website. The Wallet Moth – a blog offering finance and frugal-living advice – was born.

""I shifted into personal finance articles, as my small-but-growing audience expressed more interest in how I had avoided debt in my 20s, how I'd budgeted to have a financial safety net for freelancing and what side-hustles I worked to support being location independent,"" she says.

It's the human aspect – sharing personal stories and putting a face to the advice – that makes all the difference, she believes. ""My content doesn't necessarily offer something that is better than traditional financial advice, but people more and more want to connect with someone they can think of as an online friend, versus a faceless company.""

Purnell is among the swelling tide of financial influencers: creators feeding a seemingly insatiable desire for content on spending, saving and investing. Throughout the past few years, the popularity of these 'finfulencers' has exploded, with many amassing followings into the millions. A growing part of the global influencer industry, with an estimated market size of a whopping $104bn (£83bn) as of 2022, some of these finfluencers report earning upwards of six-figures as social media presences.

Their posts can provide welcome insight into the often-opaque world of personal finance – a world young people specifically are finding harder and harder to see into. Yet if trusting money advice from strangers with murky qualifications gives you pause, there's a reason.

A young audience

Millions of people log on every day to consume advice from financial influencers.

Humphrey Yang, a former financial adviser in his 30s, leads the finfluencer pack with more than 50m likes and 3m followers on TikTok, as of this writing. US-based Yang focuses on personal finance advice, with his most popular videos explaining concepts such as retirement accounts and stock prices. In his most-watched video – more than 14 million views – Yang acts out borrowing an iPhone, selling it and then buying the same model for less a year later in order to explain the concept of short selling.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
24,Title: The Simple Art of Rice: Seafood paella with lime,"Publication Date: 2023-09-19 00:00:00

When James Beard award-winning chef JJ Johnson owner of the fast-casual restaurant Fieldtrip in Harlem, New York, was growing up, he had Sunday night dinners at his grandmother Bebe's house. Bebe loved to make paella for this weekly gathering, and Johnson loved to eat it. ""For me, paella was just part of the culture,"" Johnson said.

In his new cookbook, The Simple Art of Rice (published this September), Johnson includes a recipe for paella inspired by the one Bebe used to make. This is one of dozens of recipes in the book that dive deep into rice around the world. ""You can use so many different rice dishes to learn about culture and people,"" Johnson said.

[jump to recipe]

Paella, the one-pan rice dish known for its crunchy texture and savory saffron flavour, originated in Valenica, Spain. ""There are so many styles of paella, with a lot of regional variations and even variations within a region,"" said Danica Novgorodoff, Johnson's coauthor. ""A traditional Valencian paella is made with meat, like rabbit, chicken and/or duck, while JJ's grandmother's paella contains exclusively seafood, which makes it more akin to a paella de marisco."" Bebe's version, inflected with her own Puerto Rican flair, had clams on the bottom, shrimp on top and a squeeze of lime to finish.

This paella was foundational to Johnson's love of cooking, but it wasn't until culinary school that Johnson began to understand the influences of Spanish food on Puerto Rican culture – and, as a result, on his very own grandmother. ""Caribbean food often marks a confluence of European, Indigenous and African culinary traditions dating back to the invasion and colonisation of the region by the Spanish beginning in the 16th Century,"" Novgorodoff said. ""Rice was introduced to the Americas by Europeans, but it was cultivated by enslaved African farmers who had expertise in rice agriculture. A dish like paella might combine Spanish spices with available local ingredients and evolving cooking methods as it's adapted over the centuries, and as distinct cultures become entwined.""

While Valencia is credited as the birthplace of paella, an even earlier version of the dish might have originated with the Moors, who are believed to have brought rice to Spain in the 8th Century. Later on, in the 18th Century, Spanish colonisers brought paella to Louisiana and, after, to Puerto Rico, where the dish became a culinary staple in its own right.

Johnson's paella, with its oversized presentation and medley of seafood on top, has a show-stopping effect. Although making the perfect paella takes skill and patience, Johnson said, ""It's easier than you think."" He keeps his version simple, emphasizing high-quality ingredients over fancy techniques.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
25,Title: Sea sponges offer lifeline to women in Zanzibar,"Publication Date: 2023-09-12 00:00:00

As a gentle morning breeze blows across the Zanzibar shore, Hindu Simai Rajabu walks through knee-deep water to reach a shallow lagoon off the coast of Jambiani, Tanzania, where her floating sponge farm is located.

Sporting shiny goggles and with a snorkel placed on top of her headscarf, Rajabu wades through the Indian Ocean, her laughter at the experience of being filmed mingling with the sound of the crashing waves.

As the tide rises, the 31-year-old mother of two swims and submerges to the depth of the buoys which hold the floating sponge farm in place.

The quest for prosperity has led Rajabu and 12 other divorced women and single mothers from Zanzibar's Jambiani village into the Indian Ocean to grow climate-resilient sponges.

Farming sea sponges has become a lucrative business for these women in recent years. Many women in Jambiani farm seaweed, but low yields due to rising sea temperatures have started to make it to earn a living. In 2009,some women began switching to growing puff-like soft sea sponges: primitive aquatic animals that, when harvested, are used for bathing and cleaning.

Sea sponges are more resilient to warmer temperatures and filter pollutants such as sewage and pesticides out ofthe water.

Local women's rights activists say sea sponge farming is helping to improve gender equality in Zanzibar and has lifted these women out of poverty. The farmers themselves say their quality of life has improved.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
26,Title: The gold jewellery made from old phones,"Publication Date: 2023-09-04 00:00:00

A chemical solution

E-waste (also known as waste electrical and electronic equipment or WEEE) is the world's fastest-growing waste stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, an estimated 50 million tonnes of e-waste is produced globally every year, weighing more than all of the commercial airliners ever made. But only 20% of that is formally recycled, and most gets thrown away and either sent to landfill or incinerated. Last year a study by price comparison service USwitch found that the UK produced the second largest amount of e-waste per person, with Norway ranking top and the US in eighth position.

As demand for more portable devices and fast electronics grows, so too will the e-waste mountain. In 2019, the World Economic Forum estimated that by 2050, annual e-waste production will more than double to 120 million tonnes.

Like all critical raw materials, gold is a finite resource, yet 7% of the world's gold is currently sitting in disused electronics. Gold extraction usually involves exporting devices to the EU or Asia where e-waste is smelted down at extremely high temperatures in a very crude and carbon-intensive process.

""We want to recover as much of the precious metals as we can from things which are currently waste,"" says Messenger. ""Our focus is on doing this sustainably within the UK, using a process that's effective at room temperature while producing a lot less greenhouse gas emissions than smelting.""

""If we're producing the waste, it should be our responsibility to sort it, we shouldn't be shipping it to another country to sort it for us,"" says Mark Loveridge, commercial director at the Royal Mint. He says that developing e-waste supply chains around localised recycling plants would dramatically cut the waste miles required to transport discarded electronics by sea, air and road, and the Royal Mint is already in talks with partners around the world with the ambition to globalise this technology.

Swapping my lab coat for an orange hard hat, high-vis jacket and black, steel-toe-capped boots, I head to the new processing plant. Dozens of huge dumpy bags are stacked up in the far corner of this 3,000 sq m (32,292 sq ft) factory, each filled with colourful circuit boards. These have been removed from laptops and mobile phones, and delivered to the factory by a network of 50 e-waste suppliers around the country.

On arrival, circuit boards are inspected and tipped into a large silver hopper which funnels this raw material into a huge multi-coloured machine. Tony Baker, director of manufacturing innovation who is overseeing the installation of this plant, explains that as circuit boards get mechanically separated and broken up, any non-gold components are kept to one side, while any gold-bearing parts such as USB ports are digitally detected and sent to a 500-litre (110 gallon) reactor. Here, the ""magic green solution"" gets added on a much larger scale, gold sand is extracted and, again, nuggets are produced.

Because so much non-gold is removed at the start, the chemical processing is only applied to fragments containing gold, as Baker explains. The raw material used by the Royal Mint is comprised of circuit boards, rather than entire laptops or whole mobile phones. Once the gold has been extracted, the leftover non-gold components are all sent off to different parts of the supply chain for reuse, so nothing gets wasted. The gold content varies between 60 parts per million to 900 parts per million, depending on the feedstock, according to Loveridge.",2023-09-12,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No
27,Title: Babcock Ranch: Florida's first hurricane-proof town,"Publication Date: 2023-09-04 00:00:00

Five days before Hurricane Ian hit, Kitson sat around a table with his team of engineers, contractors and internal managers, and pored over the layouts of Babcock Ranch. He asked them: ""Have we done everything humanly possible to ensure we're safe?""

Kitson had built the development above building code requirements – at a large additional cost – to ensure it was capable of withstanding a storm. ""We spent a lot of additional dollars to make it safe, to plan it differently from other communities,"" he says. ""The entire plan was based on the environment and resiliency. Everything we did was to address those two concerns.""

The ranch, which opened in 2018 and is around five times the size of Manhattan Island, is like a picture-postcard, with neatly manicured lawns, vibrant green golf courses, forest trails and cycle paths. Residents zip around in solar-powered golf carts, kayak on the lakes, birdwatch, and congregate at the community pools. But the beautiful aesthetics have a dual purpose: the lakes double up as retaining ponds to protect houses from floods, streets are designed to absorb excess rainfall, and the community hall is reinforced as a storm shelter. A large 870-acre solar panel farm powers the entire development, as well as surrounding communities – making Babcock Ranch America's first solar-powered town.

Hurricane Ian was to be the development's first test. ""The winds felt like a freight train running through my house,"" remembers Kitson, who lives at Babcock. ""And I remember thinking 'if we survive this the way we should, it's going to prove a point'. But you never really know until you're absolutely tested – you can do all the planning and engineering you want, but don't know for sure what the results will be.""

In the aftermath, not a single house lost power, internet, or access to clean water, and the development opened its doors to the surrounding community who had lost their homes, turning a sports hall into an emergency shelter. And when Kitson drove around the site the next morning to inspect the damage, he found that the community he had built had survived – almost unscathed, bar a few upturned palm trees and street signs.

""We had minimal damage. If we hadn't had put in place those resilient steps, we would have had tens of billions of dollars of damage. So those upfront costs to make Babcock resilient paid for themselves in just the first couple of years.""

The realisation that his climate-resilient design had worked was an ""emotional"" moment for Kitson. ""It was incredible to see this new town had really proved climate resilience planning can be done the right way.""",2023-09-15,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket,Cricket,No

29,Title: Libya flood: 'There's a smell of decay and death in the air',"Rescuers in Libya's Derna have told the BBC that bodies are continuing to wash up in the sea, a week on from the devastating floods which swept through the eastern city.

A Turkish team said they removed three bodies from the water just on Saturday morning.

There are fears for survivors in the city, with not enough medicine and clean water for those who have been made homeless.

A spokesperson for one aid organisation said trying to coordinate operations there was a ""nightmare"", with difficulty getting aid and rescue teams into the area.

Thousands of people were killed when two dams burst in the wake of Storm Daniel, washing away whole neighbourhoods in the city.

One official has denied allegations that many of those killed were told to stay at home - asserting that soldiers told people to flee.

Figures for the number of people who have been killed vary between 6,000 to 11,000. With thousands still missing, the city's mayor says the total could reach 20,000.

30,Title: Sunak briefs cabinet over changes to green targets,"To map out the UK’s path to net zero, the government’s independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), set “carbon budgets”.

These are caps on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted over five year periods for the UK to meet its international commitments.

The UK has met its three previous carbon budget targets, using provisional data for the third .

In June, before these recent rumoured changes, the CCC said it was more confident than a year ago that the UK would meet its fourth budget – which runs between 2023 and 2027.

However, it also warned that it was now “markedly less confident” than a year ago that the government would meet its fifth and sixth budgets up to 2037 – highlighting a lack of urgency to deliver on its ambitious commitments in the medium-term.

It’s difficult to quantify the exact carbon costs of the rumoured shifts in policy, because it relies on many assumptions – for example how our consumption patterns may change.

But inevitably, it would make the current targets harder to achieve – as any extra carbon costs would have to be balanced by extra savings in other areas.

The chief executive of the CCC, Chris Stark, has just said that any change to the proposed trajectory of UK emissions would be a “genuine surprise” because the “legal carbon budgets determine that path”.",2023-09-12,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

32,Title: Inflation: Surprise fall in UK inflation to 6.7%,"Getty Images Copyright: Getty Images

In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out his five priorities for 2023.

His top goal is to halve inflation - the increase in prices over time - by the end of 2023.

Inflation was at 10.7% in the three-month period between October and December 2022, which means the government aims to reduce inflation to 5.3%.

It uses a measure called the Consumer Prices Index, which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods.

At the time the prime minister made the pledge, many experts expected inflation in the UK to drop sharply - but it did not fall as quickly as expected in the first half of 2023.

As we've been reporting, in August, CPI fell slightly to 6.7% from July's figure of 6.8%.

Despite the recent falls, analysts remain divided about whether the PM's goal will be achieved .

However, the Bank of England said in August that it expected inflation to be about 5% by the end of the year, which would meet the target.

Filmed across a number of locations, from New York City to Normandy, Glastonbury to the French Riviera, the upcoming series will bring viewers closer than ever to some of the world’s most well-known personalities and Louis’s most diverse range of guests yet:

Two-time world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua

Actor and producer, Ashley Walters

Whistleblower and activist, Chelsea Manning

Hollywood icon, Dame Joan Collins

Artist and musician, Pete Doherty

Singer-songwriter, Raye

Combining one-on-one conversations with Louis’ signature immersive filming style, each of the six documentaries explore their subject’s lives and careers up to today, including those at pivotal moments in their careers. From Mindhouse productions, co-founded by Theroux, the second series is expected to air on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer later this year.

Anthony Joshua

Louis comes face to face with two-time world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, at his local boxing gym in North London. Against the backdrop of AJ’s fight with American boxer Jermaine Franklin, Louis explores his success, set-backs and his sporting motivations, as well as spending time together in the Watford estate in which AJ was raised.

Ashley Walters

In the Kent seaside town of Herne Bay, Louis meets Top Boy actor and ex-So Solid Crew rapper Ashley Walters. Ashley tells Louis about growing up in Peckham, including run-ins with the police, his transition from music to acting, and life by the sea with his partner and children.

Chelsea Manning

Louis travels to New York City to delve into the mind of one of America's most polarizing figures, famous whistleblower and activist Chelsea Manning. In 2010, Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst, released the largest set of classified documents in U.S. history and was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison for her actions. Branded a traitor by some and a hero by others, Chelsea reveals what drove her to risk everything by making the documents public, whilst sharing details of her life now as a DJ and public speaker.

Joan Collins

Louis heads to the French Riviera to meet one of the icons of Hollywood’s Golden age, Dame Joan Collins. Welcomed into her holiday home near St Tropez, Louis and Dame Joan discuss the highs and lows of her multi-decade career, including her star turns in The Stud and as Alexis in Dynasty. Louis also hits the town with Dame Joan and her husband of over 20 years, Percy Gibson.

Pete Doherty

Louis meets notorious Libertines and Babyshambles frontman Pete Doherty in Normandy, where he now lives with his wife and their baby daughter. Discussing music, drugs and his hopes for a bright future after a turbulent career, Louis also joins Pete on tour with the rest of the Libertines, and hangs out backstage at Secret Garden Party in Cambridgeshire.

Raye

In South London Louis meets the newly independent singer and songwriter, Raye. In a pivotal year that has seen her winning an Ivor Novello and nominated for a Mercury Music Prize, Louis and Raye unpack her journey from her record label split, to her number one single ‘Escapism’, and a new artistic freedom. Louis also takes to the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury to watch the 25-year-old musician as she marks this new chapter with one of her biggest performances yet.

Louis Theroux says: ""Working with the team on these six new programmes has been an enormous pleasure. The six guests are all distinctive and brilliant in different ways, all of them people who have endured setbacks and huge successes, and who have something to share with the world based on their journeys through life. We have tried to build on the success of the first six Louis Theroux Interviews, while pushing further this time into terrain that is gritty and difficult, exploring subjects like mental health, brushes with the law, and political controversy.

""Like the first six Louis Theroux Interviews, each show mixes stylish master interviews with behind-the-scenes moments and actuality shot on location, so viewers have the double pleasure of a thoughtful in-depth conversation alongside a revealing look into the lives of the contributors: in the locker room post-fight with Anthony Joshua, Raye's dressing room before her Glastonbury set, Joan Collins' house in the south of France. The tone of the shows is always open-minded and generous-hearted, while hopefully being funny, and always mindful of the need to keep viewers interested. I like them, and I'm notoriously hard to please.""

Clare Sillery, BBC Head of Commissioning, Documentaries, says: ""I am delighted that Louis is back with such an exciting and eclectic mix of new interviewees. Louis’s genuine curiosity and warmth mean that each of these meetings will bring us something very new and different and I can’t wait to see him take us deeper into the worlds of these hugely engaging cultural figures.""

The first series saw Louis up close and personal with some of the UK’s biggest stars: Stormzy; Dame Judi Dench; Yungblud; Bear Grylls; Katherine Ryan; and Rita Ora, with an average audience of more than 2.1m tuning in* (*Consolidated viewing figures for the first four episodes) in the first 7 days.

Saturday nights are even more fab-u-lous thanks to the 21st series of the multi-award-winning Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, once again bringing plenty of glitz and glamour to homes across the nation. As the Judges return to put our celebrity contestants to the test, we caught up with Shirley Ballas, Anton Du Beke, Motsi Mabuse and Craig Revel Horwood to find out about what they were up to in their 21st year, their go-to dance songs at parties and weddings, and what they're most looking forward to from Strictly 2023. Strictly Come Dancing goes live from Saturday 23 September at 6.15pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer SH3 Shirley Ballas

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? I’m super excited to return to the panel, it’s going to be one superb series. I feel so lucky to get a front row seat in the ballroom, it is a real privilege. I cannot wait to nurture and guide our new celebrities to help them become the best dancers they can be. We've asked all the Pro’s what they were doing when they were 21, what were you doing when you were 21? And what was life like for you? When I was 21 I was married to my dance partner. We were aiming to be world champions and we were dancing professionally and lecturing all over the world. Every year there is so much excitement when Strictly comes back on our screens, what keeps audiences coming back for more? I think the injection of glitz and glamour lightens up audiences' living rooms. I think viewers love to follow the journey of our celebrities throughout their time on the show and they enjoy having their own opinions and thoughts on the dances. What is the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly judge, and the biggest challenge? The biggest joy is being a small part in the nations favourite show and sharing my knowledge and passion for dance. The biggest challenge is when I hear Anton vote differently to Craig and Motsi in the dance off and then the final say is down to me. It’s so heartbreaking having to send anyone home. If you could only dance one kind of dance style for the rest of your life what would it be and why? I think it has to be the Rumba, as it’s the dance of love. It's fast, slow, sharp and soft – it’s got everything in there and it’s such a passionate dance. Do you have one stand-out dance and/or celebrity dancer from last year’s Strictly Come Dancing? It has got to be Hamza’s Salsa, what a surprise! The way he was flipping and throwing Jowita around like there’s no tomorrow, it was so impressive. I think that moment will go down in Strictly history. If you could only pick one favourite performance from all your series so far, what would it be, and why? I think it would have to be Kelvin Fletcher’s Samba with Oti in Week One in 2019. I really don’t know how it could be topped! He has this big smile on his face and his bright blue shirt. It was absolutely outstanding and also technically astonishing – definitely one to remember. Strictly returned to Blackpool last year, after some time away, how was that, and does it make you excited to return this year? It was amazing to return to Blackpool, the ballroom there is an iconic venue that holds a very special place in my heart. Being in Blackpool takes everything to a whole new level, it’s the home of ballroom dancing and the walls are steeped in history. We have 19 brilliant Pro’s for this series, how would you sum up their contribution towards the show making it what it is? It’s really simple, we wouldn’t have a show without the marvellous professional dancers. They put their all into it and work so hard to bring out the best in their celebrity partners. They dedicate so much of their craft to the show and it pays off each and every series when we see the level of dancing improve. They are such a joy to watch. Is there a song that will never fail to get you on the dancefloor at parties or weddings? It has to be I'm Still Standing by Elton John. I just can’t resist a Jive when I hear that song! Finally is there anything you are particularly excited for this series? To be back with my beautiful Judges and for all the laughs and smiles. I’m also really looking forward to fangirling over Angela Rippon! She announced me during the UK championships many times during my competitive career so her voice brings back so many fond memories. Anton Du Beke

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? I tell you what, I am naturally, brilliantly excited about the whole thing, I can't wait. For me it's just a magical time of year when Strictly returns to our screens. It always starts in the summer and goes into the autumn and winter. It's just brilliant. The excitement about Strictly Come Dancing coming back with all the celebrities and just being in the building with everybody milling around, delighted and happy and joyous and all the brilliant teams back together. It's so wonderfully exciting. We’ve asked all the Pro’s what they were doing when they were 21 What were you doing when you were 21? I would have been dancing, competing, practising and flying about trying to get better, that was my life really. I have literally been dancing every day of my life and also at 21, I think I was working in a bakery. I would have started work at the bakery at three o'clock in the morning, and then dancing at night and competing at weekends. Baker by day, dancer by night! There's so much excitement when Strictly comes back. What do you think keeps audiences coming back from? It's so multi layered and, I don't want to repeat myself too much, but it is just brilliant because there's so much about it you can love. Firstly, it's the best of the best, there is so much on the show you can enjoy. Obviously you will want to know who the celebrities are, some you'll know and some you won't know as well, and audiences will get a favourite immediately so that's always exciting in the first show. The music's amazing, the Judges are brilliant, Tess and Claudia are incredible, the frocks are fantastic, then you have all of sets and the lighting! The show is so multi-generational as well. What is the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly Judging and what's the biggest challenge? The biggest joy is being part of it and turning up every week. It's a real surprise and a fortune that I've been a part of the show since the beginning, and there’s only Craig, Tess and I left from the very first series and to have been part of a show that is part of the fabric of British consciousness – and the world’s, it’s such a global show - is sort of overwhelming, if I think about it too deeply it blows my mind. To be a part of that since the beginning, I feel massive pride. I love it now as much as I did then and I'm delighted about that as well. What is the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly judge, and the biggest challenge? The biggest challenge is eliminating somebody and sometimes it’s tighter than you'd want it to be, but that's the job and that's what I’m there for, so that is the most challenging part. Trying to be encouraging, trying to help people - that's the fun part. If you could only dance one kind of dance style for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? Probably a ballroom dance of some sort I’d imagine, taking a lady into my arms and dancing together. However, if I could do one thing more now, I’d like to become a better tap dancer because I don’t tap as well as I’d like, and I’d like that skill. Do you have one standout dance or celebrity dancer from last year’s Strictly? Helen and Gorka’s couples choice dance to Mein Herr and Hamza did some numbers that were staggering, but for pure dancing and precision Helen’s was the standout moment from last year for me. Strictly returned to Blackpool last year after some time away, how was it, and does it make you excited to return this year? Oh wasn't it brilliant?! It's such a massive production and we all go up to Blackpool and then rig it all up and it takes ten days, I mean it’s a huge thing, but it's so worth it! It's a wonderful moment in the series as well, but it means so much more than just going to Blackpool, we're going for the tower ballroom which is such an iconic venue. We’ve got 19 brilliant Pro’s this series, how would you sum up their contribution in making the show what it is? Oh epic, the Pro’s make it what it is, I've always felt this really. They're the ones to put the content for the show on the floor, they perform the group dances, they choreograph their celebrity routines, and they work with the celebrities to get the best out of them. The Pro’s are extraordinary talents and remarkable performers. Is there a song that will never fail to get you on the dance floor at weddings and parties? Dancing Queen by ABBA. Finally, is there anything you're particularly excited about for this series of Strictly Come Dancing? Just all of the above, although I am really excited about the Judges number at the beginning. What I would love to do one year, is to do a dance with one of the professionals for one of the artist numbers like I used to. There’s nothing quite like performing, it’s magical, the thing about dancing with a celebrity is you get voted off, and that’s the bit I hated! Motsi Mabuse

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? It feels amazing, and I'm super excited to meet everyone and to see how this season will develop. We've asked all the Pro’s what they were doing when they were 21, what were you doing when you were 21? And what was life like for you? I had been in Europe for three years and was dancing, minding my own business. Just dancing, my life was dancing. I was dancing in Germany and preparing for a championship. Nothing else, eat, dance and sleep, that’s it. Every year there's so much excitement when Strictly comes back on our screens. What keeps audiences coming back for more? The audiences love the dances and they love the show, it's a beautiful, emotional show, full of glitz and glamour and we all get to share it together. It's just such a special time of the year when Strictly starts. What's the biggest joy from your job as a Strictly Judge and what's the biggest challenge? The biggest joy is being part of such a professional and wonderful team that is huge and everybody's giving 110% and that that to me is quite inspiring. I think the biggest challenge for me is always the dance off because I bond with all the contestants and sending somebody home is never easy. If you could only dance one kind of dance style for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? Probably the Rumba because that means I get to dance with my husband all my life. Do you have one standout dance and or celebrity dancer from last years’ Strictly? I think the Salsa from Hamza and Jowita will remain unforgettable. If you could only pick one favourite performance from all your series so far, what would it be? It would be the week one Samba from Kelvin and Oti because he wasn't meant to be on the show. Jamie Laing had broken his leg and then Oti got Kelvin and no one could have planned anything like that, and he comes on the floor and they just burned the floor. It was absolutely amazing! Strictly returned to Blackpool last year after some time away, how was that and does it make you excited to return this year? It was fantastic being back in Blackpool because I also felt like everybody had their game on and I just can't wait to be back in in the tower ballroom for this new series. We have 19 brilliant Pro’s for this series, how would you sum up their contribution towards making the show what it is? Well, the show wouldn't be what it is without the Pro dancers, it's quite simple. It wouldn't be what it is without the dancers. They're such a big part of the show, they are the other half of a couple, so they are very, very important. Is there a song that will never fail to get you on the dance floor at parties or weddings? You Are The First, The Last, My Everything by Barry White And finally, is there anything you're particularly excited about for this series? I'm particularly excited about all the stories we're going to hear, I believe in the power of personality, there are brand new celebrities so I just want to see their personalities on the floor. Craig Revel Horwood

Strictly is back for its 21st series! How does it feel to return to the judging panel for such a monumental series? It’s like coming home for me. Every year, for the last 20 years, I have been coming home to Strictly and this is no different. I think even better because the line-up for this series is absolutely phenomenal. We have asked all the pros what they were doing when they were 21. What were you doing when you were 21? I had my 21st birthday in my hometown of Ballarat, Australia as I hired a bus to take the cast of Me and My Girl, a show I was in at the time there, and had a fantastic time. I remember my 21st so well, because it was just incredible set in a haystack and very Australian and very non-theatrical even though it was full of lots of theatre people. It was a blazing hot day as well and everyone got burned, 21 was a great year for me in the theatre. Every year, there's so much excitement when strictly comes back. What keeps audiences coming back for more? I think it's a programme that they can rely on. They know it's the lead up to Christmas and it's something they know, something they love and it's something they feel a part of. I think it embraces everybody and it has won the hearts and minds of not only this nation but so many. So there's something going right with it. I think it makes you feel like a part of the community which I think is great. What is the biggest joy you take from your job and what's the biggest challenge? The biggest joy I take from my job is getting front row seats to the best dance show in the world and the biggest challenge I think for me is making the right decisions when we're letting someone go. I think that's the hardest thing for me in the job. If you could only dance one kind of dance style the rest of your life, what would it be and why? A Charleston because that's my speciality, and it's completely different. It's such hard work and will keep me thin for the rest of my life. Anyone can do it and it doesn't matter how old you are, you can still get a bit of swivel in there! Do you have one standout dance or celebrity dancer from last year Strictly? I loved Fleur in Blackpool, she was amazing, this is when Fleur came into her own, I just loved it. She was right at home and rocking it and I got out my 10 paddle for the first time, which was great. If you could only pick one favourite performance for all your series what would it be? I think Anton Du Beke dancing with Ann Widdecombe, where he did the aeroplane move I just went ‘I cannot believe this is actually happening in front of my very eyes’ and that will stay with me until my death for all the wrong reasons, but every reason that that tells you what Strictly it's about. I think one of the best dances I've seen was Rose and Giovanni, I thought that was just amazing. Strictly returned to Blackpool last year after some time away, how was that? Does it make you excited to return this year? Yes, I really loved Blackpool! I filmed a couple of programmes up there over the summer and it was absolutely fantastic because I never get to go there in the summer. The audiences are great and the venue is bigger and I think that's exciting. And of course it has that wonderful sprung floor, so it's always great. We have 19 brilliant Pro’s the series, how would you sum up their contribution towards making the show what it is? Well, they really make the show. They are the teachers, they're the nurturers, they're the embracers, they're the ones that pick up the pieces after the Judges have judged them, they have to be all sorts of different things apart from just teachers, and they also have to be there to support, so they work really, really hard. They're the first ones in the last ones out and they're just amazing. Is there one song that will never fail to get you on the dance floor at parties or wedding? I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor. It's disco, It’s my era darling and love it. Finally, is there anything you're particularly excited about? This series, I'm really looking forward to see all the group numbers because I love those and I never get to see those until the day. Normally, I get to see them rehearse and all of that but that's what I look forward to the most.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
35,Title: How did tea become the nation's favourite drink?,"Tea may have some complicated connotations, but one of its strengths is its association with comfort and support in difficult or traumatic situations.

The taste and smell of tea tell us that we're safe before we're even consciously aware.

Clinical and forensic psychologist Dr Andrea Shortland explains that the 'tea and sympathy' tradition ""automatically cues your brain to think 'I'm okay, I'm safe now.'"" Furthermore, the offer of a cup of tea signifies ""perceived social support"" and the space to ""tell your story"", both factors that might even prevent PTSD further down the line. ""The taste and smell get to our safety centre in our brain and tell us we're safe before we're even consciously aware,"" says Andrea.

Studies even suggest that if someone is drinking a hot drink they are much more likely to rate another person more favourably and even offer to help them in some way. ""The idea of warmth,"" explains Andrea, “actually connects when we're physically warm as well as emotionally warm – they're processed in the same part of the brain.""

The PG Tips ads reinforced tea as part of the British psyche

The wildly successful ad series that used a family of anthropomorphised chimpanzees to sell PG Tips tea ran from 1956 to 2003. A copywriter hired to raise the profile of the brand hit upon the idea after walking through London Zoo and seeing a 'Chimps Tea Party', where the chimpanzees were dressed in human clothes while they played with a tea set.

Within 18 months of the campaign starting, PG Tips had jumped from fourth in the market to brand leader. ""It went on to stay brand leader for the next 40 years,"" says ad consultant and author Paul Feldwick, who worked on the PG Tips account in the 1990s, ""and it still vies for that position today.""

The ad was an example of getting an audience to identify with a brand rather than saying why it was better than its competitors. The public did eventually become uncomfortable with how the chimps were used (coinciding with an increasing difficulty in finding a suitable troupe), but the chimps' antics – such as moving pianos, racing in the Tour de France or echoing stories in the news such as the oil crisis of 1973 and the Channel Tunnel dig in 1992 – were an undeniable hit in the bygone days when mass market advertising worked, and they did their bit to reinforce tea as a staple of our culture.

The world is awash with tea

The tea market is a lot more varied than it was when PG Tips started out. For one thing there is the growth in the herbal tea market, non-caffeinated infusions such as chamomile and peppermint teas. This sector is predicted to sell £345.5 million worth of products in the UK this year.

Meanwhile, tea continues to re-invent itself across the globe. In the US, 85% of all tea consumed is iced tea, and in the Far East there is Bubble Tea from Taiwan (making it big in the UK too) which is sweet milky tea with balls of tapioca in it. Then there's Hong Kong milk tea, which uses super sweet condensed milk. This tea has even lent its name to a virtual pro-democracy movement – the Milk Tea Alliance – across Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand. Tea and politics, it seems, is as ingrained as tea and sympathy!

A proposed anti-gay bill in Kenya wants gays and lesbians jailed for 50 years for non-consensual sex.

Dubbed the Family Protection Bill 2023, the draft law sponsored by Homa Bay Town legislator Peter Kaluma, is recommending a ban on homosexuality, same-sex unions and any LGBTQ activities and campaigns.

It also seeks to prohibit gay parades, assemblies and marches on streets, and cross-dressing in public.

“A person who engages in sexual act with a person of the same sex without the consent of the other person shall upon conviction be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years and not exceeding 50 years,” says the bill.

Owners of premises used for same-sex relations will pay a fine of $14,000 (£11,000) or face a jail term of seven years if the bill goes through.

Last week, clerics and some civil society organisation groups held anti-LGBTQ protests in the coastal city of Mombasa.

37,Title: Nine things we learned from Adrian Edmondson's Desert Island Discs,"5. Shakespeare saved him from being kicked out of school

""There wasn't a drama department,” explains Adrian, talking about his boarding school, “but there was a school play and I was in every school play.”

I was going to be expelled but that was when they realised that we were halfway through Hamlet and I was Hamlet

In sixth form he was cast to play Hamlet but in the middle of rehearsals he ran away from school.

“Well, I only ran away because I was going to be expelled for the crime of throwing up in the prefects’ wastepaper bin and the headmaster got me in.”

“I was wearing two pairs of pants as usual for the usual flogging, but he didn't want to flog me this time. He said he was going to suspend me and they were thinking of expelling me.”

“So I did the only sensible thing and ran away. Eventually I ran out of money and gave myself in and I was going to be expelled. But that was when they realised that we were halfway through Hamlet and I was Hamlet.”

“And Hamlet was going to be difficult without Hamlet.”

“So they let me back in on the promise that I joined the army when I left school. I didn’t! That didn’t happen,” laughs Adrian.

6. Samuel Beckett and Brentford Nylons played key roles in his student shows

Adrian met Rik Mayall at Manchester University, and immediately found they shared many common interests: “We both thought Laurel and Hardy were the best of comedy. The other thing we shared was our love of [the Samuel Beckett play] Waiting for Godot. We were the only people who thought it was a funny play.”

Adrian and Rik began performing together, and the university drama department gave them a stage:

“We had the Stephen Joseph Studio, a little German church in the middle of the campus [named after the English stage director who pioneered theatre in the round], and we were allowed to do whatever we liked in it. Every Monday night was studio night and the rest of the department turned up [so] you'd have a guaranteed 100 in the audience and you would do your stuff.”

“I remember we bought a pair of pink duvet covers from Brentford Nylons,” says Adrian of one his and Rik’s productions, “And we were going to string them up from the studio roof and pretend to be God's testicles and talk about the world. Very sort of Waiting for Godot, really.”

7. A cigarette carton played a vital role in his relationship with Jennifer Saunders

Following university Adrian and Rik started appearing at The Comedy Store in London, as part of a growing new comedy scene.

“We were with a group of friends and it all felt very dynamic. You know, Dawn [French] and Jennifer [Saunders] came in, it was Pete [Richardson] and it was Alexei [Sayle]. It was a big family unit,” says Adrian.

The group went on to found their own comedy venue, The Comic Strip, so called because it shared premises with a strip club.

Adrian went on to marry fellow comedian Jennifer Saunders - but it took them a while after they first met to get together.

“Although I think it was love at first sight, we were both in other relationships which failed at different times so there was a kind of overlapping of relationships until we were finally separate people at the same time.”

“Eventually I remember going out to my car and there was a cigarette carton under the windscreen wiper and on it, it said, ‘I love you, love Jennifer’.”

“And that was the first time I knew.”

8. He remembers Rik Mayall with laughter and tears

After years of performing together, Adrian and Rik went their separate ways in 2003 and it wasn’t an easy split: Adrian felt they had done their best work together and, as he puts it: “I thought we'd gone over the top of the mountain. It would become increasingly sadder, and not in a funny way.” But Rik wanted to carry on and continued to put the idea of teaming up again to Adrian, who recalls:

“I hit upon the idea: ‘All right, let's write a couple of episodes of a new series, hand it in, they'll [the TV commissioners] say ‘No’, and then it's not my fault anymore.”

But then the series was commissioned - but they couldn’t complete it. Rik died in 2014 at the age of 56.

“I think of the writing room all the time,” says Adrian when he remembers Rik. “We spent more time in the writing room than anywhere else.”

“And I remember just laughing like drains.”

“His mum... his mum wrote me a lovely letter. I wrote to her after he died and she wrote back, saying all she could remember was us - she could see us out in the garden, a couple of deck chairs just laughing and laughing and laughing - and she could never tell what was quite so funny.”

“It was funny. It was good fun,” says a tearful Adrian of his memories of Rik.

9. His final disc reminds him of family harmony

Adrian selects Wide Open Spaces by The Chicks, formerly the Dixie Chicks, because it takes him back to long car trips with his whole family.

“We spent a lot of our life down in Devon, which is where we call home, and we’ve spent a lot of our lives - because a lot of work is also in London - going up and down the A303 with three kids in the back seat, my lovely daughters.”

“Wide Open Spaces is a fantastic song. It's about kids leaving home, and the three of them would be doing three-part harmonies, belting it out, driving down the A303. It's one of the wonders of my life.”",2023-09-12,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
38,Title: Five unbelievable ways longevity pioneers are trying to live forever,"1. Stitching old and young mice together

Yes, this one’s as gruesome as it sounds. Scientists Mike and Irina Conboy wanted to understand the role blood plays in how tissues age. So, to see what would happen to an old mouse when it received young blood, they stitched pairs of mice together. Mike explains, “as that tissue heals and blood vessels reform… now you have blood slowly trickling from one animal to the other.”

The results were compelling. The old mice became stronger and mentally sharper, and markers of age were reversed. Although the sample size was small, the Conboys’ findings were notable enough to be published in the peer reviewed journals Science and Nature in 2005, and they’ve influenced the longevity community ever since.

2. Getting injected with young blood plasma

Inspired by the Conboys and the research that followed, tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson has tried something pretty shocking: being injected with a young person’s blood plasma. To make sure he was getting plasma from a healthy donor, Bryan asked his then 17-year-old son to help him out. He tells Aleks, “I never imagined that my little baby would grow up and I'd be doing this procedure with him.” And it didn’t stop there: Bryan donated plasma to his dad too.",2023-09-15,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

Migrants make up about 10% of those known to have died when floods hit Libya a week ago, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has told BBC News.

Libya is hugely popular with migrants. According to data from the IOM, which is a United Nations body, more than 706,000 migrants lived in the North African country in February 2023.

Some live and work in Libya long-term, while others use it as a transit point in bids to reach Europe.

Four-hundred migrants are registered as having died in the floods, the IOM understands, although it says that this death toll is likely to change as bodies continue to be recovered.

The IOM and World Health Organization have the wider confirmed death toll at 3,900. However, officials using different methodologies have given widely varying statistics, for example, the mayor of Libyan city Derna estimates more than 20,000 people died.

Derna was, by far, hit hardest by the floods. Two dams burst amid heavy rains and swathes of the city were submerged in water.

Around 10,000 migrants lived in the port city before the flood, and the IOM ""expects the death toll of migrants to be particularly high, considering they were settled in very low-lying areas,"" IOM director of emergencies, Federico Soda, said.",2023-09-04,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
43,Title: Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate homeland in India?,"Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate homeland in India? Published 23 hours ago

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Pro-Khalistan supporters protesting in front of the Indian Consulate in Toronto in July

Diplomatic tensions over calls for a separate homeland for Sikhs in India have escalated, after Canada said it was looking at ""credible allegations potentially linking"" the Indian state to the murder of a separatist leader in British Columbia.

India has denied the allegations, describing them as ""absurd"".

For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here's an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:

Who are Sikhs and where do they live?

Sikhism is one of the world's major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan - which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.

There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group.

The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.

Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country's population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000.

Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate nation?

The Khalistan movement calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.

The movement was at its peak in the 1980s in the Indian state of Punjab, when the area experienced a series of violent attacks and thousands of deaths.

It lost steam after Indian armed forces ran special operations against the movement.

Politics in modern Punjab have shifted away from the movement and calls for independence are not a majority position, according to Prof Shruti Kapila from the University of Cambridge.

But supporters in the Sikh diaspora have continued to advocate for a separate state, with calls for independence intensifying in recent years.

Why is Khalistan so sensitive for the Indian government?

India has strongly opposed the Khalistan movement. All mainstream political parties, including in Punjab, have denounced violence and separatism.

The long-running tensions were the cause of two of the most controversial incidents in modern Indian history - the storming of the Golden Temple and the assassination of Indira Gandhi.

In June 1984, the Indian military stormed the holiest site for Sikhs and flushed out militant separatists sheltering in the temple complex in the city of Amritsar.

The assault, which resulted in many deaths and significant damage to the Golden Temple, had been ordered by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

A few months after the operation, Gandhi was killed by two of her Sikh bodyguards, which led to four days of rioting and communal violence.

Thousands of people were killed, most of whom were Sikhs. Estimates range from around 3,000 dead to as many as 17,000.

Khalistan is a red line for India because the scars of the violence in the 1980s are still fresh.

All political parties in India are united in their opposition to Sikh independence, so no Indian government can afford to overlook the Khalistan issue in the interest of bilateral diplomatic relations.

Who was Hardeep Singh Nijjar?

Hardeep Singh Nijjar was a Canadian citizen shot dead outside a Sikh temple on 18 June in Canada, at the age of 45.

He was born in Bharsinghpur village in Punjab's Jalandhar, and moved to Canada in 1997.

First he worked as a plumber, and later became a prominent Sikh leader in the western Canadian province of British Columbia.

India designated him a terrorist in 2020, for his alleged links to Khalistan Tiger Force - a group campaigning for independent Khalistan in the Punjab region of India.

His supporters called these accusations ""unfounded"" and said that he had been the target of threats in the past because of his activism.

Reports in the Indian media say he was working on organising an unofficial referendum in India for an independent Sikh state at the time of his death.

Mr Nijjar is the third prominent Sikh figure to have died unexpectedly in recent months.

How does India put pressure on diaspora Sikhs?

The backdrop to the diplomatic tensions is the growing pressure India has put on governments of three countries with sizeable Sikh populations: Canada, Australia and the UK.

India's government has openly said that a failure to tackle what it calls ""Sikh extremism"" would be an obstacle to good relations.

Australian officials said they would look into vandalism of Hindu temples by pro-Khalistan activists, but would not stop Australian Sikhs expressing their views on an independent homeland.

Canada has come in for Delhi's most open criticism for what it sees as a failure to oppose the pro-Khalistan movement there. While PM Justin Trudeau has said he will stop the ongoing violence, he has also pushed back against ""foreign interference"".

In the UK context, a row kicked off in March after protests outside the Indian High Commission in London, which saw crowds wave yellow ""Khalistan"" banners and a man detach the Indian flag from the first-floor balcony of the building.",2023-09-04,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

Image source, Getty Images

PM Rishi Sunak is expected to announce plans to weaken some of the government's green commitments.

This could include delaying a ban on the sales of new petrol and diesel cars as well as plans to phase out gas boilers.

The UK has already been criticised for falling behind in its efforts to reach ""net zero"" by 2050, a key international target intended to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

What does 'net zero' mean?

Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill.

These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.

Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries - including the UK - agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100.

To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.

However, the UN wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called ""the growing climate disaster"".

Would net zero mean a complete end to greenhouse gas emissions?

Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as ""offsetting"".

Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.

One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.

Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.

So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.

What has the UK pledged to do?

To help reach net zero by 2050, the UK has made a series of ambitious pledges including:

The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards net zero by 2050.

What has Rishi Sunak said about the government's net zero plans?

Multiple sources have told the BBC that the prime minister will shortly announce that some of these commitments will be watered down.

Responding to the reported plans, Mr Sunak said the government was committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but in a ""more proportionate way"".

When the government released its updated net zero strategy in March, many climate experts criticised the lack of significant new policies or extra investment.

What will net zero mean for individuals?

While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.

This could include:

What have other countries promised?

Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.

The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies.

The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.

India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.

What is the problem with net zero targets?

There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.

For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself.

But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.

There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels.",1 in 2015,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
47,Title: How community maps can protect children from extreme heat,"Publication Date: 2023-09-18 00:00:00

On a hot evening in August, when temperatures in Irving, a suburb in Dallas, Texas, can reach a stifling 45C (113F), outdoor pursuits and an active lifestyle can often be challenging for Christina and Landon Howard and their two young children, aged nine and 10.

""We can't go swimming or take part in other daily outdoor activities because it's just too hot outside,"" says Christina.""Our son had to came back indoors the other day after 10 minutes of skateboarding because he felt exhausted by the extreme heat conditions.""

Children are at higher risk of being hospitalised during heatwaves when temperatures exceed 29C (84F), a study on heat and children's visits to emergency departments in New York City found. Children aged 0 to four were the most vulnerable, followed by children aged 13 to 18 and five to 12.

Texan homes generally have in-built AC systems, but with little respite outdoors in the city heat, the increase in energy demand is an economic factor that the Howards are also finding burdensome.

""We're expecting to pay almost $1,000 (£787) for next month's electricity bill. This is already very alarming,"" says Landon.""There's a higher potential of having to fork out money for costly AC repairs that are going to be even more difficult for us to pay.""

Christina and Landon have decided to take matters into her own hands. In August 2023,they started volunteering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) urban heat island mapping campaign after hearing of the scheme through a volunteer callout from the City of Dallas. The initiative collects hyperlocal data to understand vulnerabilities to heat exposure. For several years, Christina and Landon have also been part of a climate change focus group in Texas, helping to make this hidden heat crisis more visible.

""We have always been interested in how climate change will affect our lives and the world, even before recycling was a thing in Texas!"" says Christina.",37 in 2021,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
48,Title: Business in Russia: Why some firms haven't left,"Publication Date: 2023-09-18 00:00:00

When the first airstrikes fell on Ukraine in February 2022, corporate executives with operations or holdings in Russia were forced to pick a side. This decision had significant implications. Russia remains a major business market, with a population of 145 million; its 2022 GDP was a staggering $2.24tn (£1.81tn), right behind France. Fleeing companies would leave a lot of revenue on the table.

Yet amid a gruelling war, with tens of thousands of civilian casualties and widespread international condemnation of Russia, companies risked severe reputational damage by staying put. Plus, a mix of international pressure, sanctions and risks of Russian government interference offered strong reasons for companies to leave when the conflict began.

""Some decided to stay, some decided to go very quickly, and some dragged their feet,"" says Roman Sidortsov, an associate professor of energy policy at Michigan Technological University, US, who practised corporate law and taught in Russia.

One of the biggest companies to pull out almost immediately was British Petroleum, which exited just three days after the conflict began. By 1 March, BMW also announced it would halt Russian production and imports. And after first announcing a plan to leave Russia in March 2022, Heineken sold off its Russian business to Russian packaging firm Arnest for a single euro this August, taking a €300m ($319m; £257m) loss on the division.

Experts disagree on exactly how many companies have left Russia – and what constitutes a 'full departure'. The Kyiv School of Economics Institute, which tracks the status of foreign companies selling or operating in Russia through its Leave Russia project, estimates around 300 have left.

According to a similar list compiled by the Yale School of Management's Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI), roughly a thousand companies have exited.

However, hundreds of foreign companies continue to operate in, or sell to, Russia. The KSE Institute claims 1,400 companies are still conducting business in some form within the country; by the CELI’s count, around 500 companies are doing so.

A recognisable name on the KSE list is PepsiCo. In early September, Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention accused the multinational soft-drink giant of continuing to produce food products in Russia despite it discontinuing Pepsi-Cola, 7Up and Miranda production.

Tech and finance giants, including Chinese firm Alibaba, also continue to conduct business there, as does British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. Airlines including Emirates, China Eastern and Air Serbia still openly advertise flights to Russia on their websites. Other businesses, like Indian refiner Chennai Petroleum, are gearing up instead of exiting: the company is expanding its services to Russia because of the invasion.

Critics of companies that have remained in Russia, including Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute founder Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, denounce these businesses as greedy, or even complicit in Russia's invasion. But ceasing operations in a country with such major business implications isn't simple. Some businesses remain because of a lack of pressure on them to leave, or due to an existential threat. Others believe staying is the most humane option for their consumers.",35 in 2019,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
49,Title: A royal tour of London's best palaces and parks with historian Tracy Borman,"Publication Date: 2023-09-19 00:00:00

London has been home for England's monarchs for more than 1,000 years – and while the British capital has changed significantly over the last centuries, it remains rich with historic royal sites, from palaces and parks to museums and churches. Where should a visitor begin?

There may be no better person to ask than Tracy Borman, historian, joint chief curator for Historic Royal Palaces and author of numerous books about, and inspired by, England's royals, from England's first Queen, Matilda, to famed Tudor King Henry VIII.

Here, she shares fascinating tips and tricks for getting the most out of London's royal sites, including where (and why) to seek out the city's ""lost"" palaces, why only seeing the Crown Jewels at the Tower should be ""treason"", and the best way to travel in Tudor footsteps… not to mention how she chose to get married at the ""saddest spot on Earth"" (and why it's worth a visit).

Let's start with the Tower of London – such a popular site for visitors, and one you've written a whole book about. You called the story of the Tower ""the story of England"". Why?



With that book, I thought I was writing about the Tower. But I was actually writing about England, because so many national events took place at the Tower that changed history. The Tower begins with the Norman Conquest of 1066 – William the Conqueror has to subdue England somehow, so he builds this mighty fortress – and it continues to be at the heart of affairs well into the 1600s. Even today, it has an important part to play; it's also home to the Crown Jewels.",11 in 2019,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

Truly iconic fashion moments don't come along that often, but at the start of the 1990s there was a succession of them. The decade began with an era-defining British Vogue cover, shot by Peter Lindbergh, and featuring Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington – the most in-demand models of the time, photographed on the streets of New York in Levi's and bodysuits.

That was soon followed by George Michael's Freedom '90 video – directed by David Fincher and starring the same five women – a cultural touchstone still reverberating decades later. It was such a hit – played in heavy rotation on the then-dominant MTV – that in March 1991 Gianni Versace sent four of the models down the runway to its soundtrack. If you want to know what a supermodel is, take a look at those women strutting arm-in-arm down the catwalk; glamour, confidence, power and money bouncing off them.

51,Title: How I rewired my brain in six weeks,"Publication Date: 2023-09-12 00:00:00

Our brain has an incredible ability to adapt, learn and grow because by its nature, it is plastic – that is, it changes. This is called neuroplasticity, which simply means the brain's ability to adapt and evolve over time in structure and function. It was once thought to be limited to youth but we now know it's a constant force in shaping who we are. Every time we learn a new skill, our brain adapts.

Neuroscientists and psychologists are now finding that we have the power to control that to some extent. And there's good reason to want to boost our brain – an increasing number of studies suggest it can play a role in delaying or preventing degenerative brain diseases.

So, with the help of Thorsten Barnhofer, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Surrey in the UK, that's what I set out to do. He's currently running a study on the effects of mindfulness in managing stress and difficult emotions, with a special focus on individuals with severe depression.

I was surprised that something as simple as mindfulness can play such a crucial role in keeping our minds healthy. Research has shown that mindfulness is a simple but powerful way to enhance several cognitive functions. It can improve attention, relieve pain and reduce stress. Research has found that after only a few months of mindfulness training, certain depression and anxiety symptoms can ease – though as with any complex mental health problem, this may of course vary depending on individual circumstances.

There's more to it. Mindfulness can change the brain. That's because when the stress hormone cortisol increases and remains high, ""it can become toxic for your brain"", says Barnhofer. Stress can also directly inhibit neuroplasticity, so managing it allows the brain to remain more plastic.

The question is, would this work in my brain? Over six weeks, Barnhofer modified a mindfulness research course for me to try out. For 30 minutes a day, either as one single session or two 15-minute sessions, I practiced a guided mindfulness meditation by listening to a recording. In addition, I had one weekly meditation session with Barnhofer, who guided me over Zoom. The full mindfulness course can be accessed online for free.

My instructions were to be as aware as possible to the present moment – and pay attention to things I might usually ignore, such as where my thoughts go, and what occupies my mind from moment to moment. He also encouraged me to be more mindful in daily life – say when cooking or running, to really focus on the moment, bringing my mind back to what I was doing, as well as noticing how often it wanders.",2023-09-21,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
52,Title: Should you trust personal finance advice from a 'finfluencer'?,"Publication Date: 2023-09-15 00:00:00

When Yasmin Purnell started blogging in 2017, she planned to share her experiences of becoming a digital nomad. However, the creative-writing graduate and copywriter soon found visitors to her site were more interested in how she afforded her freelance lifestyle.

Noticing the hunger for personal finance advice, UK-based Purnell, now 31, rebranded her website. The Wallet Moth – a blog offering finance and frugal-living advice – was born.

""I shifted into personal finance articles, as my small-but-growing audience expressed more interest in how I had avoided debt in my 20s, how I'd budgeted to have a financial safety net for freelancing and what side-hustles I worked to support being location independent,"" she says.

It's the human aspect – sharing personal stories and putting a face to the advice – that makes all the difference, she believes. ""My content doesn't necessarily offer something that is better than traditional financial advice, but people more and more want to connect with someone they can think of as an online friend, versus a faceless company.""

Purnell is among the swelling tide of financial influencers: creators feeding a seemingly insatiable desire for content on spending, saving and investing. Throughout the past few years, the popularity of these 'finfulencers' has exploded, with many amassing followings into the millions. A growing part of the global influencer industry, with an estimated market size of a whopping $104bn (£83bn) as of 2022, some of these finfluencers report earning upwards of six-figures as social media presences.

Their posts can provide welcome insight into the often-opaque world of personal finance – a world young people specifically are finding harder and harder to see into. Yet if trusting money advice from strangers with murky qualifications gives you pause, there's a reason.

A young audience

Millions of people log on every day to consume advice from financial influencers.

Humphrey Yang, a former financial adviser in his 30s, leads the finfluencer pack with more than 50m likes and 3m followers on TikTok, as of this writing. US-based Yang focuses on personal finance advice, with his most popular videos explaining concepts such as retirement accounts and stock prices. In his most-watched video – more than 14 million views – Yang acts out borrowing an iPhone, selling it and then buying the same model for less a year later in order to explain the concept of short selling.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
53,Title: The Simple Art of Rice: Seafood paella with lime,"Publication Date: 2023-09-19 00:00:00

When James Beard award-winning chef JJ Johnson owner of the fast-casual restaurant Fieldtrip in Harlem, New York, was growing up, he had Sunday night dinners at his grandmother Bebe's house. Bebe loved to make paella for this weekly gathering, and Johnson loved to eat it. ""For me, paella was just part of the culture,"" Johnson said.

In his new cookbook, The Simple Art of Rice (published this September), Johnson includes a recipe for paella inspired by the one Bebe used to make. This is one of dozens of recipes in the book that dive deep into rice around the world. ""You can use so many different rice dishes to learn about culture and people,"" Johnson said.

[jump to recipe]

Paella, the one-pan rice dish known for its crunchy texture and savory saffron flavour, originated in Valenica, Spain. ""There are so many styles of paella, with a lot of regional variations and even variations within a region,"" said Danica Novgorodoff, Johnson's coauthor. ""A traditional Valencian paella is made with meat, like rabbit, chicken and/or duck, while JJ's grandmother's paella contains exclusively seafood, which makes it more akin to a paella de marisco."" Bebe's version, inflected with her own Puerto Rican flair, had clams on the bottom, shrimp on top and a squeeze of lime to finish.

This paella was foundational to Johnson's love of cooking, but it wasn't until culinary school that Johnson began to understand the influences of Spanish food on Puerto Rican culture – and, as a result, on his very own grandmother. ""Caribbean food often marks a confluence of European, Indigenous and African culinary traditions dating back to the invasion and colonisation of the region by the Spanish beginning in the 16th Century,"" Novgorodoff said. ""Rice was introduced to the Americas by Europeans, but it was cultivated by enslaved African farmers who had expertise in rice agriculture. A dish like paella might combine Spanish spices with available local ingredients and evolving cooking methods as it's adapted over the centuries, and as distinct cultures become entwined.""

While Valencia is credited as the birthplace of paella, an even earlier version of the dish might have originated with the Moors, who are believed to have brought rice to Spain in the 8th Century. Later on, in the 18th Century, Spanish colonisers brought paella to Louisiana and, after, to Puerto Rico, where the dish became a culinary staple in its own right.

Johnson's paella, with its oversized presentation and medley of seafood on top, has a show-stopping effect. Although making the perfect paella takes skill and patience, Johnson said, ""It's easier than you think."" He keeps his version simple, emphasizing high-quality ingredients over fancy techniques.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

Extending off the rugged north-western tip of Australia's island-state of Tasmania is a wildly remote peninsula with a bleak name: Cape Grim (officially Kennaook/Cape Grim).

Few travellers make it to this region known as the ""Edge of the World"". But those who do come will find dramatic cliffs, windswept heaths and black-sand beaches in striking contrast to the verdant patchwork farmland on the hilltops.

This isolation has not only kept Cape Grim beautifully raw but given it an unusual claim to fame: this is where you'll find some of the cleanest air on Earth, according to the air pollution station located on the cape.

One of 25 worldwide atmospheric stations, the cliff-top Cape Grim Baseline Atmospheric Pollution Station (CGBAPS) was created in 1976 to collect and analyse the composition of this pristine air, which is unaffected by local pollution sources such as exhaust fumes or industrial smoke.

""The strong westerly winds that buffet the Kennaook/Cape Grim air monitoring station have travelled thousands of kilometres over the icy Southern Ocean, making air measured here some of the cleanest in the world,"" said Dr Ann Stewart, senior research scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which jointly manages the site with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
55,Title: Sea sponges offer lifeline to women in Zanzibar,"Publication Date: 2023-09-12 00:00:00

As a gentle morning breeze blows across the Zanzibar shore, Hindu Simai Rajabu walks through knee-deep water to reach a shallow lagoon off the coast of Jambiani, Tanzania, where her floating sponge farm is located.

Sporting shiny goggles and with a snorkel placed on top of her headscarf, Rajabu wades through the Indian Ocean, her laughter at the experience of being filmed mingling with the sound of the crashing waves.

As the tide rises, the 31-year-old mother of two swims and submerges to the depth of the buoys which hold the floating sponge farm in place.

The quest for prosperity has led Rajabu and 12 other divorced women and single mothers from Zanzibar's Jambiani village into the Indian Ocean to grow climate-resilient sponges.

Farming sea sponges has become a lucrative business for these women in recent years. Many women in Jambiani farm seaweed, but low yields due to rising sea temperatures have started to make it to earn a living. In 2009,some women began switching to growing puff-like soft sea sponges: primitive aquatic animals that, when harvested, are used for bathing and cleaning.

Sea sponges are more resilient to warmer temperatures and filter pollutants such as sewage and pesticides out ofthe water.

Local women's rights activists say sea sponge farming is helping to improve gender equality in Zanzibar and has lifted these women out of poverty. The farmers themselves say their quality of life has improved.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

A chemical solution

E-waste (also known as waste electrical and electronic equipment or WEEE) is the world's fastest-growing waste stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, an estimated 50 million tonnes of e-waste is produced globally every year, weighing more than all of the commercial airliners ever made. But only 20% of that is formally recycled, and most gets thrown away and either sent to landfill or incinerated. Last year a study by price comparison service USwitch found that the UK produced the second largest amount of e-waste per person, with Norway ranking top and the US in eighth position.

As demand for more portable devices and fast electronics grows, so too will the e-waste mountain. In 2019, the World Economic Forum estimated that by 2050, annual e-waste production will more than double to 120 million tonnes.

Like all critical raw materials, gold is a finite resource, yet 7% of the world's gold is currently sitting in disused electronics. Gold extraction usually involves exporting devices to the EU or Asia where e-waste is smelted down at extremely high temperatures in a very crude and carbon-intensive process.

""We want to recover as much of the precious metals as we can from things which are currently waste,"" says Messenger. ""Our focus is on doing this sustainably within the UK, using a process that's effective at room temperature while producing a lot less greenhouse gas emissions than smelting.""

""If we're producing the waste, it should be our responsibility to sort it, we shouldn't be shipping it to another country to sort it for us,"" says Mark Loveridge, commercial director at the Royal Mint. He says that developing e-waste supply chains around localised recycling plants would dramatically cut the waste miles required to transport discarded electronics by sea, air and road, and the Royal Mint is already in talks with partners around the world with the ambition to globalise this technology.

Dozens of huge dumpy bags are stacked up in the far corner of this 3,000 sq m (32,292 sq ft) factory, each filled with colourful circuit boards. These have been removed from laptops and mobile phones, and delivered to the factory by a network of 50 e-waste suppliers around the country.

On arrival, circuit boards are inspected and tipped into a large silver hopper which funnels this raw material into a huge multi-coloured machine. Tony Baker, director of manufacturing innovation who is overseeing the installation of this plant, explains that as circuit boards get mechanically separated and broken up, any non-gold components are kept to one side, while any gold-bearing parts such as USB ports are digitally detected and sent to a 500-litre (110 gallon) reactor. Here, the ""magic green solution"" gets added on a much larger scale, gold sand is extracted and, again, nuggets are produced.

Because so much non-gold is removed at the start, the chemical processing is only applied to fragments containing gold, as Baker explains. The raw material used by the Royal Mint is comprised of circuit boards, rather than entire laptops or whole mobile phones. Once the gold has been extracted, the leftover non-gold components are all sent off to different parts of the supply chain for reuse, so nothing gets wasted. The gold content varies between 60 parts per million to 900 parts per million, depending on the feedstock, according to Loveridge.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No
57,Title: Babcock Ranch: Florida's first hurricane-proof town,"Publication Date: 2023-09-04 00:00:00

Five days before Hurricane Ian hit, Kitson sat around a table with his team of engineers, contractors and internal managers, and pored over the layouts of Babcock Ranch. He asked them: ""Have we done everything humanly possible to ensure we're safe?""

Kitson had built the development above building code requirements – at a large additional cost – to ensure it was capable of withstanding a storm. ""We spent a lot of additional dollars to make it safe, to plan it differently from other communities,"" he says. ""The entire plan was based on the environment and resiliency. Everything we did was to address those two concerns.""

The ranch, which opened in 2018 and is around five times the size of Manhattan Island, is like a picture-postcard, with neatly manicured lawns, vibrant green golf courses, forest trails and cycle paths. Residents zip around in solar-powered golf carts, kayak on the lakes, birdwatch, and congregate at the community pools. But the beautiful aesthetics have a dual purpose: the lakes double up as retaining ponds to protect houses from floods, streets are designed to absorb excess rainfall, and the community hall is reinforced as a storm shelter. A large 870-acre solar panel farm powers the entire development, as well as surrounding communities – making Babcock Ranch America's first solar-powered town.

Hurricane Ian was to be the development's first test. ""The winds felt like a freight train running through my house,"" remembers Kitson, who lives at Babcock. ""And I remember thinking 'if we survive this the way we should, it's going to prove a point'. But you never really know until you're absolutely tested – you can do all the planning and engineering you want, but don't know for sure what the results will be.""

In the aftermath, not a single house lost power, internet, or access to clean water, and the development opened its doors to the surrounding community who had lost their homes, turning a sports hall into an emergency shelter. And when Kitson drove around the site the next morning to inspect the damage, he found that the community he had built had survived – almost unscathed, bar a few upturned palm trees and street signs.

""We had minimal damage. If we hadn't had put in place those resilient steps, we would have had tens of billions of dollars of damage. So those upfront costs to make Babcock resilient paid for themselves in just the first couple of years.""

The realisation that his climate-resilient design had worked was an ""emotional"" moment for Kitson. ""It was incredible to see this new town had really proved climate resilience planning can be done the right way.""",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football,Cricket,No

Title: WWE Rumors on Randy Orton Return; Chris Jericho on Edge in AEW; Samoa Joe on CM Punk

Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe and All Elite Wrestling.

Orton Reportedly in Great Shape Ahead of Potential Return

Future WWE Hall of Famer Randy Orton is reportedly preparing for his return to the ring after missing the past 16 months with a back injury.

After video surfaced on social media that seemingly showed Orton outside the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida, Fightful's Sean Ross Sapp confirmed that Orton has indeed been at the PC this week.

It was also reportedly by Fightful Select (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), that while Orton hadn't yet been cleared to resume in-ring training as of early August, sources indicated The Viper had gotten ""huge"" thanks to his hard work in the gym.

If Orton is doing ring work at the Performance Center, it seemingly indicates that he may not be too far off from returning to WWE programming.

Prior to landing on the shelf, Orton was in a tag team with Matt Riddle called RK-Bro, and collectively they were one of the most beloved acts in WWE.

Orton and Riddle dropped the Raw Tag Team Championships to The Usos in a champion vs. champion match on a May 2022 episode of SmackDown, and The Usos put Orton through the announce table afterward, which was WWE's way of writing him off television.

The most sensible move would likely be to bring Orton back as a babyface since fans would be excited to see the return of the Apex Predator, and that could make him a candidate to go up against The Bloodline.

The Bloodline was responsible for injuring him in a storyline sense, and Roman Reigns may need an opponent if he defends the undisputed WWE Universal Championship at Crown Jewel and Survivor Series in November, making Orton the ideal candidate if he can make it back by then.

Jericho Believes AEW Could Refresh Edge

Amid speculation that WWE Hall of Famer Edge could potentially make the leap to AEW, Chris Jericho made a case in favor of the move.

During an appearance on the Superstar Crossover podcast (h/t Upton), Jericho was asked about Edge possibly signing with AEW, and he explained why he feels it would make sense from Edge's perspective:

""Well, I mean, who's to say for sure? But if you look at Chris Jericho, for example, where I was in WWE, there really wasn't much more that I could do there. You're there for many years, and you've wrestled everybody, and it's great. But it's always good to shock people, and to show up with a new kind of mission.

""So I think somebody like Edge, you know, there's a lot of guys over [in WWE] like this. They've kind of done everything they can do there. For him to come to AEW with a whole fresh new coat of paint, a whole new roster of matches that he can have, obviously a new name, which would then, knowing him, knowing me, what I would do is a whole new look—a whole new mindset. That's the best thing about having AEW and about us being as successful as we are, is that there's now a viable alternative. I don't wanna say, competitor, because it's not that, but you can now go to either company.""

Last month, Edge wrestled what he said was the final match of his current WWE contract, defeating Sheamus on SmackDown in his hometown of Toronto.

The Rated-R Superstar went on to confirm that his contract officially expires at the end of September, which generated plenty of discussion about whether he might consider jumping ship to AEW.

PWTorch's Wade Keller reported that Edge ""presented to WWE what it would take to retain his services, but WWE declined to meet his request,"" before adding that people within WWE expected him to sign with AEW as a result.

In a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, Edge refuted the part of the report about WWE rejecting his requests, saying: ""There's nothing going on. There's no hard feelings between me and WWE. I love WWE, it's my dream gig. It's all I ever wanted to do. I didn't come at them with some crazy contract or anything, they didn't deny me. I have a contract extension sitting in my inbox, I just don't know what to do.""

Edge suggested that retirement was among his considerations since he was unsure if he would be able to top the match he had with Sheamus.

However, if Edge wants to continue wrestling and doesn't want to do it in WWE, AEW would be his best option.

He has several close friends in AEW, such as Christian Cage, FTR and Jericho, plus there would be plenty of potential for intriguing matchups, as Jericho alluded to.

Jericho essentially did it all in WWE before opting to be part of AEW's formation, and that decision has likely added longevity to Jericho's career. Since Edge is in a similar situation, it is possible he could follow that same path.

Samoa Joe Talks Perception of CM Punk

Samoa Joe gave his thoughts on CM Punk this week following Punk's recent firing from AEW.

In an interview with Joseph Staszewski of the New York Post, Joe was asked if he feels Punk is misunderstood as a person, to which he replied:

""I'd imagine there are tons of things that are misunderstood or portrayed about him. Now, what those things are it's who's representing in what way. I can't really give you a blanket statement as far as what those things are. For the most part, our relationship has been very, especially for these years, has been very non-wrestling related. It's just been extraneous stuff outside of the world of wrestling and talking about life stuff.""

At AEW All In last month in London, Punk competed in his final match for the promotion, beating Joe to retain the ""real"" AEW World Championship.

According to multiple accounts, Punk got into a physical altercation with ""Jungle Boy"" Jack Perry backstage before the match, ultimately leading to the decision to terminate Punk's contract.

After Punk left WWE in January 2014, he stayed out of pro wrestling until 2021 when he signed with AEW amid a ton of fanfare.

Punk went on to become a two-time AEW world champion and had numerous great matches and rivalries, but backstage issues were seemingly the deathblow to his time with the company.

For essentially his entire career, Punk has never been afraid to speak his mind and stand up for what he believes in, and that has at times made for a reputation that he is difficult to work with.

There has been a great deal of speculation regarding whether Punk might sign with WWE now that he is done with WWE, and whether or not that happens may come down to how WWE perceives Punk and his ability to fit into the locker room without causing drama.",2023-08-22,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
60,Title: LA Knight Will Be Triple H's Greatest Triumph as Head of WWE,"3 of 6

In the immediate aftermath of his feud with Wyatt, it was apparent WWE had no meaningful plans in place for Knight on the Road to WrestleMania 39.

Despite racking up losses to the likes of Cody Rhodes, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, his crowd reactions grew louder by the week. His television time was inconsistent, and his absence at The Show of Shows in Los Angeles was inexcusable, but his shtick was starting to grow on the WWE Universe and planted the seeds for a babyface turn.

Fans figured his time to shine would come after 'Mania season, but nothing materialized. The same was said when the 2023 WWE draft wrapped up, but he remained directionless.

His biggest break up to that point in his main roster run came in the men's Money in the Bank ladder match. WWE went with the logical choice of Damian Priest as the winner, but the outrage online over Knight's failure to take home the briefcase sent the message that the company needed to be forced by the fans into finding something significant for him to do.

The Megastar could have easily stayed stagnant in the midcard waiting for another chance to come his way, but he instead took matters into his own hands and led one of the most organic movements WWE has seen since Daniel Bryan nearly a decade ago.",2023-08-22,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
61,Title: Fantasy Booking The Rock's Path to Roman Reigns Match at WWE WrestleMania 40,"Credit: WWE.com

The Rock's surprise return to WWE SmackDown on Friday electrified fans and led to the inevitable questions about a potential in-ring return and the long-awaited dream match with undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns.

The Great One told The Pat McAfee Show earlier in the day that the match with The Tribal Chief was ""locked in"" for WrestleMania 39 but ultimately did not happen.

He further teased the fight for next April in Philadelphia in some back and forth that was anything but official (around the 1:38:00 mark):

While the contest is no closer than it was before the WWE icon took to the stage with McAfee, it does beg the question: How does the company get to such a dream match without upsetting everything it has established over the last three years of storytelling?

The answer is simpler than you might think.

A Story of Redemption

There is not a single instance in which a showdown between Rock and Reigns needs the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the center of it, certainly not when Cody Rhodes has patiently waited to finish a story that probably should have culminated in Los Angeles last April.

To get to the showdown of generational Superstars, The Tribal Chief must drop his title to The American Nightmare on one of WWE's other grand stages: the Royal Rumble.

Would it mean more for Rhodes for it to happen under the brightest lights at WrestleMania? Absolutely, hence why it really should have happened in L.A.

With that said, The American Nightmare defeating Reigns, overcoming potential interference from Solo Sikoa and Jimmy Uso to do so, on the enormous stage that the Rumble provides would be a suitable consolation.

In the wake of the monumental defeat, the following Friday on SmackDown, Reigns should throw around accusations and blame for his loss. He singles out Jimmy, points the finger at Sikoa and even eyes Paul Heyman as part of the problem.

Then, The Rock returns in another surprise cameo. This time, he comes face-to-face with the man against whom most expect him to have his next (last?) match. He talks about Reigns' run but, instead of acknowledging his greatness, he blames him for letting the family down.

He calls Reigns out for his selfishness and egotism. He criticizes his gaslighting of those closest to him and claims The Bloodline's dominance over WWE should have lasted decades, but it crumbled because The Tribal Chief let his own self-centeredness get in the way.

A dismayed Reigns orders Sikoa and Uso to attack but they walk out on him, none too pleased over the verbal smackdown they received moments earlier. When the former champion tries to handle it himself, he eats a Rock Bottom and People's Elbow to hammer home the bad week he has had.

From there, Rock should be used sparingly. Yes, his SmackDown appearance drove in tremendous television and social media numbers, but if he became a regular on TV, he would lose some of the specialness that helped drive those figures in the first place.

One would include a vicious beatdown from Reigns, who gets one over on The Great One and convinces him to accept his challenge for a battle of The Bloodline at WrestleMania.

Who really is the greatest to come out of the family? Who is the undisputed Tribal Chief?

It is a marquee, main event match that can conclude Night 1 or 2 at Lincoln Financial Field without holding up the most prestigious prize in the company along the way.

It is a strong enough match, between two of the top stars in wrestling history, that it does not need championship gold to be taken seriously in that role.

Rhodes gets his run, WWE gets what would likely be the biggest money-making match in company history, and the booking remains true to the story that has been in play since August 2020.",2023-08-22,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

63,"Title: WWE Rumors on CM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Jade Cargill, LA Knight, Edge and Drew McIntyre","Michael Kovac/Getty Images for IMDb

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

WWE Reportedly Not as High on Signing CM Punk as It Was Cody Rhodes

WWE could potentially make a huge splash by signing CM Punk now that he is a free agent, but the company reportedly isn't as excited about that prospect as it was about signing another former AEW star a year and a half ago.

According to HausofWrestling.com's Nick Hausman, there was far more internal buzz when Cody Rhodes became a free agent last year than there has been for Punk thus far.

Rhodes became the first huge name to defect from AEW to WWE, as the former AEW executive vice president and one of the company's founders made his WWE return as the surprise opponent for Seth Rollins at WrestleMania 38.

Since then, Rhodes has been firmly established as one of WWE's top stars, winning the 2023 men's Royal Rumble match and challenging Roman Reigns for the undisputed WWE Universal Championship in the main event of WrestleMania 39.

While WWE reportedly isn't as high on the idea of signing Punk as it was Rhodes, it apparently remains possible.

Hausman noted that nobody he spoke to within WWE ruled out the idea of the company signing Punk, especially if ""good business can be done.""

Punk didn't leave WWE on great terms in January 2014, and he certainly didn't have positive things to say about his time in WWE upon signing with AEW in 2021.

Also, given that Punk had multiple backstage issues during his time in AEW that led to his firing from the company, WWE may be treading lightly due to concern about Punk possibly interrupting the locker room chemistry.

Still, Punk is a massive star, and there is no bigger signing WWE or any other wrestling company can make at the moment.

Punk was a multi-time world champion in WWE, and he went on to win the AEW World Championship twice, and oftentimes moved the needle when it came to ratings and attendance.

There are many intriguing matches and rivalries Punk could have in WWE, so signing him is something that should at least be considered even if it doesn't come to fruition.

WWE Reportedly Had Long-Term Interest in Cargill, Creative is a 'High Priority'

WWE has reportedly had interest in signing Jade Cargill when her AEW contract expired for quite some time.

According to Fightful Select (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), some people in WWE heard of the company's interest in Cargill as early as July, and it now looks like she is trending toward joining WWE after three years with AEW.

PWInsider.com's Mike Johnson reported this week that Cargill's AEW contract was believed to have expired, and plans were in place for her to report to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida.

Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Radio (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News) later reported that WWE has already been making creative plans for Cargill and view her likely arrival as a ""big thing.""

Meltzer also noted that while Cargill signing with WWE wasn't officially locked in as of Monday, the company made her a substantial financial offer compared to most other newcomers when they sign with the company.

Per Meltzer (h/t Upton), the creative plans for Cargill are related to the main roster rather than NXT, and WWE is making them a ""high priority.""

Before joining AEW in 2020, Cargill had never competed in a pro wrestling match. Despite that, she quickly emerged as one of the top stars in the women's division.

Jade went 60-0 before losing to Kris Statlander at Double or Nothing in May, ending her record reign of 508 days as the inaugural TBS champion.

Cargill seemingly possesses all of the superlatives WWE looks for in a Superstar, including athleticism, size, strength, charisma and a marketable look.

Refining her in-ring work is likely the last piece of the puzzle that Cargill needs to complete, and once that happens, she'll have the tools needed to be a star at the same level as Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, Bianca Belair and Rhea Ripley.

WWE Reportedly Far Apart on Money with Knight, McIntyre, Edge

WWE reportedly isn't on the same page with three of its top stars when it comes to financial terms amid contract negotiations.

According to Meltzer (h/t Randall Ortman of Cageside Seats), WWE is ""not close on money"" with LA Knight, Drew McIntyre and Edge currently.

Knight is in the early stages of what seems to be a major push, as he won a battle royal at SummerSlam and later defeated The Miz in a singles match at Payback. He has also been getting consistent television and promo time on SmackDown, and often gets the biggest crowd reaction of the night.

PWInsider.com (h/t Upton) reportedly recently that Knight and WWE were closing in on a new deal of up to five years in length, but it apparently hasn't been made official yet.

There have long been rumors and speculation floating out there about McIntyre's contract status, and PWInsider Elite (h/t WrestlingInc's Liam O'Loughlin) reported last week that WWE added some time to McIntyre's contract while he was out injured, meaning it is set to expire in April 2024.

McIntyre was originally under contract with WWE from 2007 to 2014 before getting released. He returned to the company in 2017 and has been one of its top stars ever since.

He won the 2020 men's Royal Rumble match and went on to become a two-time WWE champion. He hasn't held a title in quite some time, but The Scottish Warrior remains a key player for WWE.

Edge is a WWE Hall of Famer who has made it clear that he is nearing the end of his career at 49 years of age.

Last month, he faced Sheamus on an episode of SmackDown in his hometown of Toronto in what Edge said was the final match on his WWE contract. He later confirmed that his deal ends at the conclusion of September.

PWTorch's Wade Keller reported last month that Edge ""presented to WWE what it would take to retain his services, but WWE declined to meet his request,"" leading to an internal belief that Edge would sign with AEW.

The Rated-R Superstar refuted the report in a subsequent video, saying: ""There's nothing going on. There's no hard feelings between me and WWE. I love WWE, it's my dream gig. It's all I ever wanted to do. I didn't come at them with some crazy contract or anything, they didn't deny me. I have a contract extension sitting in my inbox, I just don't know what to do.""

AEW is likely an option for Edge if he wants to take that route, but his comments suggest he hasn't closed the door on WWE either.

Knight, McIntyre and Edge are all performers who can be main event players for WWE at any time, so it stands to reason that WWE will be hard at work in the coming weeks and months to lock all of them into deals if possible.",2023-08-21,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

This week's show was full of rematches that did little to advance their storylines, a few strange booking decisions, and an impromptu NXT women's title match that nobody will remember tomorrow.

To be clear, this week's show being weak is solely due to the booking. The men and women of WWE always make sure they do their best to entertain the crowd in the arena and the fans at home, but they can only do so much with what they are given.

The standout match this week was probably Kingston vs. Ivar, which wasn't even the original plan heading into Monday night. Nakamura and Ricochet had a fun encounter, but something about Ivar doing a moonsault is always going to make a match stand out.

The next PPV isn't too far away. This needs to be where the majority of WWE's current storylines end.

66,"Title: Booking WWE SmackDown's Main-Event Scene, Samoa Joe as AEW Champ, More Quick Takes","1 of 5

SmackDown suffered a significant hit coming out of SummerSlam when Roman Reigns took his latest hiatus and Jey Uso moved to Monday Night Raw. The drama with the remaining members of The Bloodline hasn't been enough to keep the audience invested.

The immediate future of the blue brand's main-event scene became much clearer on Friday's show when AJ Styles saved John Cena from Solo Sikoa and Jimmy Uso, seemingly setting up a tag team match for the Fastlane pay-per-view in early October.

That should segue immediately into Styles challenging Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the rumored Crown Jewel event in November. Although it's obvious he won't win, Styles is the perfect person for The Tribal Chief to defend against at this stage of his reign.

In the meantime, WWE can continue building up the white-hot LA Knight, who teased pursuing championship gold last Friday on SmackDown. He would be another compelling contender for Reigns come the Royal Rumble in January.

The long-term plan should still be Cody Rhodes and Reigns renewing their rivalry and Rhodes becoming champ at WrestleMania 40, despite recent rumblings of The Rock returning.",2023-09-01,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Aaron Rodgers has never shied away from his love of professional wrestling, with his famous ""discount double check"" celebration mimicking him wearing a championship belt.

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from WWE.

Triple H Says LA Knight is 'My Age'

Kevin Nash's ongoing battle with LA Knight just took another turn, and he may have made Triple H look bad in the process.

Nash again spoke about Knight on his podcast and revealed the contents of a private conversation with Triple H, who apparently expressed frustration with the tenor of contract talks with the rising star.

""I mean, the guy, it took him 29 years to get over, so he's gonna make mistakes along the way,"" Nash said, ""because he wasn't like he had any kind of clear-cut pattern or plans to make it besides he figured he just, The Rock and Steve have been gone long enough that he would just do their s--t. I hear, I see where he's up for a new contract. So I called Triple H. I said, 'What's the deal with this?'

""You know, because early it said that, you know, negotiations are going great and all of a sudden it seemed like there was a hitch. [Triple H] told me, he goes, 'I didn't understand why this kid, and I use that term lightly.' I said, 'What do you mean? He goes, 'Kid. The guy is my age.' I said, 'I don't think he's quite your age.' ' He's pretty damn close.' 'I said, are you more worried about the fact his fan appeal will recede as fast as his hairline is? Is that something you're worried about?'

...

[Triple H] said, 'We're so far apart because the only way I'll sign this guy is on a nostalgia act.' I said, 'You mean like me, like, be on the legends.' He goes, 'Yeah, well he's doing their s--t. I can't give him the same pay as guys that are going out there and doing original s--t.""

Of course, we must start out by acknowledging Nash's podcast is regularly tongue-in-cheek. Nash admitted his comments about CM Punk were largely done to drive interest in his podcast, and there's no doubt he's aware of the headlines his initial comments on Knight drew across social media.

It's unclear where the line is in this instance. Nash's initial thoughts on Knight appeared to be genuine, but at some point, this morphed into a worked-shoot podcast feud.

What makes his latest comments interesting is involving Triple H, who is WWE's head of creative and has been booking Knight in a fashion some fans feel is below how over he is with the crowd. It's possible Nash's comments offered actual insight into how Triple H feels, but it's equally likely Nash is doing this all as a rib to generate interest.

If it's the latter, job well done.

John Cena Listed as 'Greatest of All Time' on Internal Roster

While there will forever be debate about the greatest professional wrestler of all time among fans, WWE thinks the matter is settled.

Fightful Select reported Cena is listed as the ""greatest of all time"" backstage for this week's SmackDown broadcast.

The first SmackDown of the TKO era was a memorable one for WWE, with The Rock's surprise return and Cena's presence driving a massive social media pop. The YouTube video of Rock and Cena's backstage interaction has nearly two million views as of publication.

Cena's in-ring accomplishments make it hard to argue against his GOAT status. He's tied with Ric Flair for the most world championships all time (16) and was the singular star who propped up WWE programming for more than a decade.

Workrate fiends will never give Cena even Mount Rushmore treatment, let alone putting him as the greatest of all time. His move set was never the greatest and his matches during his peak often put him at seemingly insurmountable odds, only for ""Super Cena"" to consistently overcome.

That said, absence creates appreciation. Cena's become more beloved in recent years during his sporadic appearances than he was at points during his peak.

Natalya Praised for Stepping Up in India

Natalya has only one singles championship across her lengthy WWE career, but her consistent professionalism has long been praised.

She's consistently taken on any role and storyline asked by WWE—even ones that were directly embarrassing to her (and arguably the business as a whole). Maintaining that professionalism and reputation as a safe worker has given her a seemingly endless in-ring career, even as she stays on the lower midcard level of the women's division.

Natalya's do-anything attitude was reportedly on display in India, as she worked against Rhea Ripley and Zoey Stark at the Superstar Spectacle.

It is almost a certainty that when WWE first looked at its plans for Survivor Series months ago, the idea of LA Knight challenging Roman Reigns was not even a thought.

Knight was building momentum but the thought of him becoming the hottest star in the industry and a guy whose pops have rivaled those of John freaking Cena likely never crossed WWE officials' minds.

That is exactly what happened and given recent teases during backstage vignettes involving Paul Heyman, and the crowd's reaction to Knight dropping Reigns' name Friday night on SmackDown, it certainly feels like a direction the company is heading in.

Given what is sure to be a red-hot crowd in Chicago, and the elevated stage the historically significant Survivor Series premium live event presents, it is the perfect time to pull the proverbial trigger on the high-stakes, high-profile match.

Knight is as hot as he has ever been and, barring a massive creative blunder should remain that way leading into the November 25 event. Do not waste time and assume he can sustain momentum all the way to January's Royal Rumble.

WWE fans got an unexpected surprise when The Rock's signature music played and he walked onto the stage. After a prolonged back-and-forth with Austin Theory, he delivered the People's Elbow to the two-time United States champion.

The Rock also crossed paths with John Cena backstage, allowing the two titans to catch up.

This is bound to throw more fuel onto the fire when it comes to a hypothetical WrestleMania main event between The Rock and Roman Reigns. Members of the WWE Universe have thrown around the idea for years without it becoming a reality.

After a wild end to August and an even wilder start to September, wrestling fans have turned their attention to the rest of 2023 and possible feuds in WWE and AEW.

From the possibility of Edge making the jump to All Elite Wrestling and feuding with former teammate Christian, to Rhea Ripley avenging Dominik Mysterio's hatred of his dad and winning the United States Championship from Rey, there are a plethora of marquee storylines that both companies should be producing before the end of the year.

Here are the WWE and AEW feuds wrestling fans want to see immediately.

Adam Copeland vs. Christian

One of the biggest possible storylines for the remainder of 2023 will be centered around where Edge appears next.

Whether he returns to WWE programming or Adam Copeland makes his AEW debut, his career is likely not over despite his goodbye tour in Toronto.

After being forced to retire due in 2011 to a devastating neck injury, Edge returned with a vengeance nine years later, putting on classic matches and building storylines that helped other talents get over with the fans.

Now, it's time for Copeland to fill the void left by CM Punk and give AEW fans something to get excited about.

With Christian being an absolute menace on weekly programming, threatening and attacking every performer who has lost a father, Copeland could be the company's saving grace, providing a mainstream superstar status and putting over a plethora of young faces along the way.

However, before he gets to make everyone else on the roster better, Copeland must stop Christian playing mind games with other performers who have lost their father.

Rhea Ripley vs. Rey Mysterio

Rhea Ripley is already one of the most dominant female Superstars of all time, but the one way to ensure her credibility would be to have her fight for a men's title against one of the most talented male performers ever.

The Eradicator must beat Rey Mysterio for the United States Championship.

The storyline writes itself, as Ripley and Mysterio's son, Dom, have been enthralled in a storyline relationship that has produced some of the most heated segments of the year.

With Rey still focused on repairing his relationship with his child, it would be the perfect opportunity for Ripley to decimate the distracted father and walk out with a men's secondary championship.

By earning the U.S. title, Ripley would transcend the women's division and become one of the biggest stars in all of wrestling.

Regardless of who she would lose it to eventually, beating Mysterio and holding a men's belt would build her credibility to hardcore and casual fans alike.

CM Punk vs. Kevin Owens

After being fired from AEW with cause after a backstage altercation at All In, former AEW world champion CM Punk could be looking to get back into the business via a new contract with WWE.

While details of the incident and his contract are scarce, it's possible Punk could make a surprise return around Survivor Series on November 25.

According to recent reports, Punk could be looking to work against someone like Kevin Owens, a longtime friend of The Young Bucks who have voiced their displeasure against Punk and his camp previously.

With a tinge of reality in the story, WWE would be wise to capitalize on the momentum by giving Punk a chance to redeem himself.

Owens is a consummate professional, providing fans with memorable bouts against performers of all shapes and sizes. Punk and KO would put on an instant classic in the ring, but it would be their battle on the microphone that truly turns heads.

With Triple H in charge of creative and Punk given enough slack to feel fulfilled, the two men should devise an innovative method of storytelling that gives fans a taste of what was going on in AEW while creating a new angle from a WWE perspective.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

In what was potentially her last match with AEW for now, Cargill lost to Kris Statlander in the main event of Rampage on Friday.

One would expect Cargill to make a major impact right out of the gate in WWE, and her first feud will help to establish where she fits into the hierarchy of the women's division. Beating Seth Rollins at WrestleMania 38 helped set the tone for Cody Rhodes' return to the company.

WWE legend and Hollywood acting superstar Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson surprised University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders on the set of ESPN College GameDay in Boulder, Colorado, on Saturday.

College GameDay was on location at the University of Colorado prior to the Buffaloes' rivalry game with Colorado State on Saturday night. After discussing the game and his team's success this season, Coach Prime was taken aback by The Rock's presence:

On Friday, The Rock was in Boulder for an appearance on ESPN analyst Pat McAfee's talk show The Pat McAfee Show, and he dropped some bombshells during the interview, including saying that he had an agreement in place to face Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 39 earlier this year before talks broke down.

The Great One also went on to say that he is open to the possibility of taking on Reigns at WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia next year.

Later on Friday night, The Rock made a surprise appearance on WWE SmackDown, which was held in nearby Denver.

McAfee opened the show with a surprise appearance of his own before getting interrupted by Austin Theory, who he beat in a match at WrestleMania 38 last year.

As Theory criticized the fans and claimed SmackDown was his show, The Rock arrived to massive cheers and proceeded to cut a promo on Theory.

The segment ended with The Rock hitting Theory with a People's Elbow, followed by McAfee doing the same.

Johnson seemingly stayed in Colorado overnight, which allowed him to catch Sanders by surprise and electrify the live crowd in Boulder on Saturday morning.

The Rock praised Sanders for his success, for changing the culture within the University of Colorado football team and for changing the way things are done in college football.

Colorado went just 1-11 last season, but after arriving from Jackson State, Sanders brought in over 70 new players and took the Buffs from the basement to possible Pac-12 title contention.

74,Title: Video: CM Punk Fuels WWE Rumors During CFFC MMA Appearance Following AEW Firing,"Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images

CM Punk seemed to tease a potential WWE return while providing commentary at an MMA show on Friday night.

Punk was part of the announce team for Cage Fury Fighting Championships at CFFC 125, and when his broadcast partner jokingly asked him if he has time on his hands, Punk said, ""Yea, I got some time on my hands. For the next two months.""

After being out of the wrestling business for over seven years, Punk made his return for AEW in 2021. There were some remarkable highs during his AEW tenure, including winning the AEW World Championship twice, but there were also some major lows.

Most notably, Punk reportedly got into multiple backstage altercations, and the one that led to his firing from the company saw him get physical with ""Jungle Boy"" Jack Perry at Wembley Stadium in London for All In last month.

AEW president Tony Khan announced Punk's termination days later, making him a free agent in pro wrestling terms.

Wrestlers often have non-compete clauses in their contracts with WWE or AEW, meaning they cannot wrestle for another promotion for a certain amount of days after their release.

It is possible Punk was referencing that with his comment Friday night, or it could have been a nod to WWE's upcoming Survivor Series premium live event.

Survivor Series is just over two months away on Nov. 25, and it will emanate from Punk's hometown of Chicago.

Punk always receives a massive hero's welcome in the Windy City, meaning there would be no more impactful way for WWE to bring him back than to do it at Survivor Series in Chicago.

It is unclear if there is any level of mutual interest between Punk and WWE, but if Punk wants to continue wrestling at a high level, WWE may be his only legitimate option.

When asked this week about Punk (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), WWE president Nick Khan gave something of a non-answer regarding WWE's potential interest in him, saying:

""Listen, we only have respect for Phil [Brooks aka CM Punk]. We appreciate his run here. We appreciate what he did and tried to do with the UFC. Not many people can actually get in there and do what he did. So, when we have respect for Phil, we wish him nothing but the best.""

Khan didn't come across as being over the moon about the idea of signing Punk, but it could have been a case of him not wanting to provide any hints about WWE's plans.

There are some concerns that come along with Punk, including whether he will be able to work well with others, but there is no denying his value.

Punk moved the needle for AEW in terms of attendance, ratings and merchandise sales, and there is little doubt that he would do big business for WWE if the two sides can strike a deal for him to come back for the first time since January 2014.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

This might just be the easiest ""buy"" of the week. While it's safe to presume AEW would want to do everything in its power to keep the 31-year-old Superstar, Cargill seems to have every justifiable reason to want to jump.

Cargill simply has WWE written all over her, whether we're talking about in-ring style or that unmatchable charisma and presence. She'd be droves bigger in WWE and a likely main-eventer, especially compared to the creative purgatory she sat in with AEW.

76,Title: Hot Take: Why WWE Should Avoid Roman Reigns vs. The Rock at WrestleMania 40,"It sure sounds like The Rock vs. Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40 could happen, considering certain comments by the former recently.

Just one request—please don't.

A Rock-Reigns main event at 'Mania sounds amazing, almost like the perfect end to the Tribal Chief's Bloodline story that has captivated pro wrestling with near-unstoppable momentum.

Except it's too late.

First, what The Rock told Pat McAfee during a recent interview before his surprise appearance on the September 15 edition of SmackDown:

Long story short, Rock seemed to confirm that this was actually the main-event plan for WrestleMania 39 before plans changed. He also noted that he's open to the match at WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia.

But that's just it—the big chance to get this right was at 'Mania 39. Everything about the build to that event seemed to lay the groundwork for a Rock return, from the Royal Rumble to 'Mania itself going down in Hollywood.

Instead, fans got this awkward-feeling Cody Rhodes rumble win and sudden insertion into a family-based storyline, only for him to lose. Granted, Rhodes messing around with Brock Lesnar and others before linking back up with Reigns to ""finish the story"" at 40 isn't all that appealing either.

But it feels like things have organically moved on at this point. The time is now for Reigns to be defending and ultimately losing the unified titles, potentially to someone like Solo Sikoa after a betrayal. Or, even riding this surprising wave of momentum Jey Uso suddenly enjoys on Raw.

Rock coming in now would derail both of those chances in a major way and extend a Bloodline story that is already starting to wear thin with fans. Sure, it would get a pop when fans first realize what's happening, but those supposed story idea differences that stopped this from happening at 39 will probably pop up when discussing it happening at 40, too. Because in this hypothetical, if Rock wins, then what? He drops it to someone else, but the winner never bested Roman? And what if Reigns wins, another year with the titles?

Truth is—and this will get an eye roll from some, but it is what it is—Rock vs. Reigns doesn't need a title. WWE would be much better off having the current Tribal Chief go to 'Mania and lose to either Sikoa or Jey. Or, if WWE so insists, Rhodes. Though we won't waste hundreds of words on it here, Seth Rollins and that Shield connection would make more sense if they want to go outside of a family angle to end it.

Anyway, maybe the best move would be Reigns losing at WrestleMania 40, then a feud with Rock kicks in. The reasoning behind the matchup can be whatever it wants then because it suddenly isn't tied to the titles and possibly ruining chances for other Superstars who will be in WWE longer (Rock is a part-timer at best and Reigns might be going Hollywood himself).

This way, fans could still be happy as it gets that Rock is back and totally unconcerned with the long-term ramifications. The idea this feud would need titles at all feels like a byproduct of the bygone Vince McMahon era of creative anyway.

The only title necessary between Rock and Reigns would be the title of Tribal Chief, anyway. It would be the biggest match in a long time, perhaps bigger than Stone Cold's return, even if it does need to wait until WrestleMania 41 (and Stone Cold didn't need a title, either).

All of this even presumes Rock would come back. He's 51 years old already and had his last actual long program with a full match in 2013 with John Cena (the quick joke match against Erick Rowan at 'Mania in 2016 doesn't count). He even suffered an injury during the match against Cena at WrestleMania 29.

Right now, Bloodline as a whole and this Reigns run registers as one of the best sagas of pro wrestling ever. His holding the title an extra long time while waiting for Rock to come out of movie limbo for a match would diminish both the story and reign, spoiling it in hindsight.

So much of pro wrestling is timing. If Reigns had bested the Rock at the last 'Mania and we were just getting knee deep into Reigns-Jey-Jimmy beef the entire story would be even more well regarded.

But the timing was botched. That creates a ripple effect. WrestleMania 40 is where Reigns should drop the belts, then opening the door for a legitimate feud with the Rock that doesn't have messy long-term story ramifications. Maybe Rock even comes in during the aftermath motivated and angry at Roman for tearing the family apart.",2023-09-21,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

It had been nearly four years but it felt like an eternity.

But on Friday night at Ball Arena in Denver, the wrestling world fell into delirium as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson made an appearance on Friday Night Smackdown and as always had an electrifying performance.

Stepping into a segment between Pat McAfee and Austin Theory, The Rock and Theory got into a bit of a war of words before the latter made the unwise decision to try and take out The People's Champion.

What he wound up getting was the people's elbow from both Johnson and McAfee.

It was a moment no one in Ball Arena was expecting, though in hindsight Johnson appearing on McAfee's show earlier in the day in Boulder may have been a pretty good clue.

It's unclear how much longer Johnson plans to stick around the wrestling world but his devoted fans are just hoping he won't be going out on another four-year hiatus. The last time they got a chance to see The Rock in action was the 20th anniversary episode of Smackdown on Oct. 4, 2019.

Backstage, Finn Balor attempted to lure Jimmy Uso into joining The Judgment Day based on the idea that there are no leaders, no one to be beholden to. Uso appeared somewhat interested.

Back in the arena, the LWO's Rey Mysterio, Santos Escobar, Zelina Vega, Cruz Del Toro, and Joaquin Wilde were in the ring for a special promo.

After Escobar respectfully challenged Mysterio for the United States Championship, the unnamed trio of Bobby Lashley and The Street Profits interrupted the festivities, leading to a tag team match.

Montez Ford and Angel Dawkins defeated Del Toro and Wilde in a quick match, putting the babyfaces away in a bout that was anything but competitive. A post-match attack further solidified the group as heels.

This was fine but Del Toro and Wilde are quickly losing credibility following a squash loss to Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn two weeks ago and this quick defeat here. LWO is as strong as the sum of its parts and if two of the five are viewed as glorified enhancement stars, it will ultimately hurt the overall value of the group.

Mysterio vs. Escobar should be fun but after this, it would not be surprising if Lashley is ultimately the one to dethrone the Hall of Famer.

WWE alluded to a criticism Colorado State head football coach Jay Norvell made of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders this week during the closing segment of Friday night's episode of SmackDown.

Grayson Waller had WWE legend John Cena on as a guest on The Grayson Waller Effect talk show. Cena wore his signature hat, prompting Waller to say, ""When I talk to grown-ups, I take off my hat like my mother taught me.""

That line was an obvious nod to something Norvell said about Sanders this week ahead of Saturday night's Rocky Mountain Showdown rivalry game between Colorado State and Colorado at Folsom Field in Boulder.

Per ESPN's Kyle Bonagura, Norvell took a jab at Sanders on his weekly radio show Wednesday, saying: ""I don't care if they hear this in Boulder. I told them [ESPN]—I took my hat off, and I took my glasses off. I said, 'When I talk to grown-ups, I take my hat and my glasses off. That's what my mother taught me.'""

Norvell was clearly referencing Sanders, whose signature look since becoming the Buffs' head coach has been a cowboy hat and sunglasses.

According to Bonagura, a video posted on YouTube showed Sanders addressing his team after the remarks were made, and he noted that Norvell had made things personal between the two teams:

""I'm minding my own business watching some film, trying to get ready, trying to get out here and be the best coach that I could be, and I look up and I read some bull junk that they had said about us, once again. Why would you want to talk about us when we don't talk about nobody? All we do is go out here, work our butts off and do our job on Saturday. But when they give us ammunition, they done messed around and made it [personal].

""It was just gonna be a good game and they done messed around and made it personal. It was gonna be a great task—a battle of Colorado—but they done messed around and made it [personal].""

The 18th-ranked Buffaloes are huge favorites against the Rams after starting off their season 2-0 with a pair of impressive wins.

Colorado went just 1-11 last season, but Coach Prime led the team to a 45-42 upset win over then-No. 17 TCU on the road in Week 1, followed by a dominant 36-14 win against Nebraska last weekend at home.

WWE has long had a penchant for referencing things that are happening in mainstream sports, and given the SmackDown was in Denver, Waller's comment received a noticeable reaction.

Waller has quickly developed into a heel who WWE fans love to hate, and it was another feather in his cap to take a shot at both Cena and Sanders while in the state of Colorado on Friday.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
81,"Title: WWE Rumors on Roman Reigns' Return, Potential Roster Cuts, Vince McMahon and Triple H","Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Reigns' Next Title Defense Reportedly Scheduled for Crown Jewel

Undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns has not had a match since SummerSlam last month, and he reportedly isn't scheduled to have his next title defense for quite some time.

According to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), the expectation is that The Tribal Chief will not have his next televised match until Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4.

Most recently, Reigns faced cousin Jey Uso in a Tribal Combat in the main event of SummerSlam, and he retained the title thanks to interference from Jey's twin brother, Jimmy Uso.

Reigns recently surpassed three years and the 1,100-day mark as world champion, but over the past year in particular, his title defenses have been few and far between.

The Head of the Table is presented as an attraction who typically only competes at the biggest events, whereas WWE world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins is on essentially every premium live event.

WWE's next PLE is Fastlane on Oct. 7, and there has been no indication that Reigns will wrestle on the show or even appear on it.

If not, then Crown Jewel is a logical spot for his next title defense since Reigns is typically always featured at the events in Saudi Arabia.

After Crown Jewel, WWE's next premium live event is one of the company's tentpole spectacles in Survivor Series on Nov. 25.

At last year's Survivor Series, Reigns competed as part of The Bloodline in WarGames. If WarGames returns, it is possible Roman will wrestle without defending his title at Survivor Series.

Reigns' opponent for Crown Jewel isn't yet known, but it will be a huge deal regardless of who steps up just as all of his title defenses tend to be.

WWE Talent Cuts Reportedly Expected After Merger

Following the official merger of WWE and UFC into TKO Group Holdings this week, talent releases are reportedly expected within WWE.

According to Haus of Wrestling's Nick Hausman, a source in WWE said ""major cuts"" of main roster and NXT talent are expected, although it wasn't yet known when the moves would potentially be made.

Per Hausman, WWE president Nick Khan issued a memo to WWE employees Thursday asking them to work remotely on Friday amid ""workforce reductions.""

Fightful's Sean Ross Sapp reported that there were many WWE releases on Friday among executives and those who work in marketing, digital and other areas, but none among the talent roster.

PWInsider.com (h/t Upton) reported that talent cuts were not expected to be made Friday, but it wasn't specified if they would be made at a later date or not at all.

Layoffs and firings are typical when mergers occur in the business world, oftentimes in the interest of eliminating redundant positions.

Since WWE isn't gaining any new wrestlers in the merger with UFC, it stands to reason that there could be far fewer cuts in that department than there have been on the executive side.

WWE Talent Reportedly Want Triple H Calling Creative Shots

WWE talent reportedly wanted Triple H to be the main creative decision-maker over Vince McMahon once the merger with UFC took place this week.

According to Meltzer (h/t Upton), anonymous talent said they hoped McMahon would have no involvement with creative after the merger and were told Triple H would be in charge, but McMahon reportedly made changes to Raw remotely on Monday.

In the summer of 2022, McMahon stepped down from his roles as WWE chairman and CEO, and Triple H subsequently took over as head of creative.

McMahon returned as chairman in January of this year to facilitate the sale of WWE, and numerous reports have indicated that he has contributed creatively since then.

While McMahon has reportedly rarely been backstage for Raw, SmackDown and premium live events, and Triple H has been the point man in those scenarios, McMahon has reportedly made changes remotely.

Meltzer (h/t Hausman) reported that McMahon recently returned from a medical leave of absence after undergoing spinal surgery, and he was present when the WWE merger was finalized.

82,Title: The Rock Teases Roman Reigns Match for WWE WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia,"Bob Levey/Getty Images

WWE legend Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson teased the possibility of facing his cousin, Roman Reigns, at WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia next year during an appearance Friday on ESPN.

In an interview on the Pat McAfee Show, The Rock said he is ""open"" to taking on Reigns at WrestleMania 40 and noted that there is ""potential"" for it to happen.

Johnson confirmed a longstanding rumor that the original plan was for him to headline WrestleMania 39 against Reigns earlier this year.

The Rock said he reached a handshake deal and a verbal agreement with WWE chairman Vince McMahon and president Nick Khan in early 2022 for the match to happen in April 2023, but the parties involved could not come to an understanding on what the next part of the storyline would be.

Johnson said he wanted to give the fans something special with the idea that WrestleMania 39 would be the start of a longer story, but when nothing could be decided, the match was called off.

With The Rock out of the equation for WrestleMania 39, Cody Rhodes won the men's Royal Rumble match from the No. 30 spot after returning from a torn pec, and he went on to challenge Reigns for the undisputed WWE Universal Championship.

Rhodes and The Tribal Chief clashed in Night 2 of WrestleMania 39, and while it seemed as though everything was set up for The American Nightmare to win, Solo Sikoa interfered and helped Reigns retain.

Since then, the overarching assumption among wrestling fans has been that WWE would build Rhodes back up and give him another crack at Reigns at WrestleMania 40, although The Rock's comments suggest another option may now be on the table.

The 51-year-old Johnson ceased working a full-time WWE scheduled in 2003, and after competing at WrestleMania 20 in 2004, he did not have another match for over seven years.

The Rock returned to WWE in 2011 to work a program with John Cena, beating him at WrestleMania 28 before defeating CM Punk for the WWE Championship at Royal Rumble 2013.

Johnson then dropped the title to Cena in the main event of WrestleMania 29, thus completing his return to WWE.

The Rock has made several appearances for WWE since then, including beating Erick Rowan in mere seconds in an impromptu match at WrestleMania 32 in 2016, but he hasn't had a legitimate match with build in over a decade.

That is largely due to the fact that The Rock has been focused on other ventures, including his work as one of the biggest actors in Hollywood. He is also one of the owners of the XFL, which played its first season since the relaunch this past spring.

It was widely assumed that The Rock's outside interests were the main reason why the rumored match against Reigns at WrestleMania 39 didn't come to fruition, but he suggested Friday that his decision was influenced by creative differences.

WrestleMania 39 seemingly would have been the perfect spot for The Rock vs. Reigns since it was near The Rock's adopted home of Hollywood, but WrestleMania 40 would be a great fit for multiple reasons as well.

In addition to the fact that it is a landmark WrestleMania, Philly played host to The Rock's first WrestleMania main event, as he faced ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin in the WrestleMania 15 headliner.

Reigns is in the midst of one of the greatest title runs in WWE history, having held a world title for over 1,100 days consecutively, plus he has done the best character work of his career as a heel over the past three years.

His character is tailor made to go up against The Rock since Reigns claims to be The Head of the Table and the main provider for his family, which is something Johnson could easily challenge.

It is unclear where it would leave Rhodes if Reigns vs. The Rock happens at WrestleMania 40, but given that it is the biggest possible dream match in the industry, WWE will likely jump at the chance to secure it if Reigns and The Rock can reach a new agreement.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
83,Title: Fantasy Booking Jade Cargill in WWE Amid AEW Exit Rumors,"Photo credit: All Elite Wrestling

Tonight's episode of AEW Rampage has become must-see television because it could be the last time we see Jade Cargill appear for All Elite Wrestling.

Fans couldn't have guessed this after the inaugural TBS champion made her surprise return less than a week ago during the latest edition of Collision. However, Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful.com broke the news that she is finishing up with the company after this week's tapings in Cincinnati and heading to WWE.

According to his report from Fightful Select, ""Upon returning backstage following her match with Kris Statlander in Cincinnati, Jade was greeted by several members of the roster who exchanged hugs. It was seen as a farewell within the company.""

Sapp also reported that ""some top WWE Superstars had heard that Cargill was heading to the company as early as last week, and it was a topic of discussion backstage at Raw.""

If this move does come to fruition, it will be a massive blow to AEW and an excellent acquisition for its distinguished competition. Now, the largest purveyor of sports entertainment in the world has an opportunity to turn this diamond in the rough into one of its brightest stars.

Accentuate Her Strengths and Alleviate Doubt

It's hard to understate how big of a deal it would be if one of AEW's most pivotal homegrown talents jumps ship. Cody Rhodes' journey back to WWE to finish the story was also monumental but debatably less shocking.

Cargill could absolutely benefit from a change of scenery, but she seemed poised to take over the world as a women's world champion. Yes, the 31-year-old accomplished a lot since her debut in 2020, but she could've been a prominent star for years to come.

That's precisely why WWE should strike while the iron is hot, and put her on the flagship show with the same presentation. Like Rhodes, she should try to debut with current theme music and everything that already worked. Don't change her name or put her on NXT; showcase her as a major free agent signing from day one.

That's part of what made Chris Jericho's debut during the Attitude era so memorable. In fact, the Vero Beach, Florida native should come straight in and interrupt Trish Stratus during a promo.

We haven't seen the WWE Hall of Famer since Payback, but the exchange writes itself. After greeting Stratus, Cargill quickly lays her a Jaded, the finishing move Jazz popularized, and states, ""She was the past, but I'm the future of women's wrestling.""

Photo credit: All Elite Wrestling

This doesn't have to turn into a feud, but it would be a great moment and a perfect way to introduce her to a new audience. Afterward, the first woman to take offense to this would be Natalya, leading to her first match with the company on Raw.

This may not sound like an exciting first opponent for Cargill, but it will start to create the story around her disrespecting the legends who came before her. More importantly, a television match with Nattie could help to change the perception of her work in-ring.

She already has the presence, jaw-dropping physique, work ethic, buzz, and accolades from her time with AEW. Quality matches with proven workers will give her more experience and prove that she can hang with the best.

Tony Khan did such a great job of protecting her and using her winning streak to accentuate her strengths. However, many of her appearances became repetitive, and she didn't take part in enough noteworthy storylines.

WWE has to avoid making the same mistakes. Throw her in the deep end. Give her longer matches and start meaningful feuds.

Who Will Be Her Major Feud?

Cargill reportedly can sign imminently. Still, it may be too late to build towards a showing at Fastlane on Oct. 7.

Instead, it would make more sense to shoot for an outing at Survivor Series in November. In the meantime, focus on giving her convincing wins on Raw or SmackDown, but continue to plant the seeds for encounters with more legends.

The payoff would be in January when she eliminates as many returning stars in the women's Royal Rumble match as possible until she meets her match in Beth Phoenix. This is also the ideal stage for her first staredown with Bianca Belair or Charlotte Flair.

The EST of WWE and The Queen seem destined to face each other at WrestleMania 40. So, it doesn't seem likely that Cargill will stand across the ring from either of them on The Grandest Stage of Them All, but Phoenix could be a fantastic option.

Conversely, it wouldn't be a terrible idea for her to dethrone Becky Lynch and become the next NXT women's champion. This would give WWE the chance to present her as a main roster superstar and use her on the developmental brand.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
84,Title: Video: The Rock Credits Deion Sanders for 'Changing the Face' of CFB at Colorado,"Dustin Bradford/Getty Images

As Deion Sanders' imprint on college football continues to get bigger with each passing week, it's only fitting that he would be praised by someone who left a rather large mark of his own in another sport.

Appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, The Rock credited Coach Prime for ""changing the face of college football"" in his short time at Colorado.

Even though it's only been two games for the Buffaloes, it's hard to overstate how dramatic the change feels for the program. They went 1-11 last season and have only made two bowl appearances since 2008.

Colorado's 36-14 win over Nebraska on Sept. 9 was the second-most watched game of the day with 8.73 million viewers. The only game that was viewed more was Texas vs. Alabama in Tuscaloosa (8.76 million viewers).

The Nebraska-Colorado game actually beat Texas-Alabama in the demo rating (4.8 to 4.5). ESPN is basically doing a summit in Boulder this weekend with First Take, The Pat McAfee Show and College Gameday broadcasting from the campus.

There aren't many people who give off the aura of being larger-than-life figures. The Rock is one of them because his acting has made him a worldwide superstar after he became one of the most iconic wrestlers of all-time during his tenure in WWE.

Sanders carries the same larger-than-life aura even as he's moved into the coaching ranks. Primetime always felt like a superstar during his days as a player because he had immense swagger and was able to back it up by doing things on the football field no one else was capable of.

Being able to take that same confident swagger and turn it into high-level performance as a coach is special. Coach Prime took over the Jackson State team in 2020 when the program hadn't had a winning season since 2013.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

The top three selections for the 2023 PWI 500 are fitting since Rollins, Reigns and Moxley (formerly known as Dean Ambrose) broke into WWE together in 2012 as The Shield, and established themselves as one of the most dominant and successful stables in wrestling history.

Per SiriusXM's Busted Open Radio, the top 10 in this year's PWI 500 is as follows:

1. Seth Rollins (WWE)

2. Roman Reigns (WWE)

3. Jon Moxley (AEW)

4. Gunther (WWE)

5. El Hijo del Vikingo (AAA)

6. MJF (AEW)

7. Kazuchika Okada (NJPW)

8. Orange Cassidy (AEW)

9. Josh Alexander (Impact)

10. Cody Rhodes (WWE)

Rollins, who was previously No. 1 in 2015 and 2019, beat AJ Styles in a tournament final at Night of Champions in May to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

That victory further solidified The Visionary as the face of Monday Night Raw, which is a distinction he had already earned with numerous fantastic rivalries and matches over the past year.

Reigns is No. 2 on the list after topping it both last year and in 2016. There has been no more dominant figure in pro wrestling over the past three years than The Tribal Chief.

The reigning undisputed WWE universal champion, Reigns has now held a world title for over 1,100 consecutive days, and there is no immediate end in sight to his run on top.

It is likely that the biggest deciding factor in Rollins surpassing Reigns on the PWI 500 this year is the fact that Reigns has worked a part-time schedule and only defended his title occasionally, whereas Rollins has done so with great regularity.

Moxley, who was No. 1 in the 2020 PWI 500, is the current AEW international champion, beating Orange Cassidy for the title in the main event of All Out a couple of weeks ago.

Mox is also a three-time AEW world champion, most recently holding it for roughly two months from September 2022 until November 2022 when he dropped it to MJF.

MJF and Cassidy are AEW's other representatives in the top 10 at Nos. 6 and 8, respectively, while WWE also has two more choices in Gunther at No. 4 and Cody Rhodes at No. 10.

It can be argued that Gunther is already well positioned to improve on his career-best position of fourth and take the top spot next year, barring injury.

Last week, Gunther defeated Chad Gable in the main event of Raw to clinch the longest intercontinental title reign of all time, surpassing The Honky Tonk Man's previous record of 454 days.

Gunther has not lost a singles match since getting called up to WWE's main roster well over a year ago, he consistently has strong in-ring performances and is presented like a major star.

Because of those factors, The Ring General is perhaps the favorite to win the 2024 men's Royal Rumble match before going on to WrestleMania 40 and becoming world champion.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
88,Title: WWE Rumors: Latest on Edge's Roster Status amid Contract Buzz and AEW Speculation,"FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP via Getty Images

With his contract set to expire at the end of September, Edge's status on the internal WWE roster has reportedly changed.

According to PWInsider.com's Mike Johnson, Edge is no longer listed on the internal roster as an active TV performer for SmackDown, as he has been moved to a ""miscellaneous"" talent list.

That list reportedly includes both injured Superstars and legends such as Big E, Braun Strowman, Titus O'Neil, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Undertaker.

Prior to facing Sheamus on an episode of SmackDown in his hometown of Toronto last month, Edge revealed it was the final match on his WWE contract. He later noted that the deal officially expires at the end of September.

While WWE gave Edge a 25th anniversary celebration surrounding the match against Sheamus, the fact that there wasn't much build toward the match and that it wasn't billed as a retirement match led to rumors and speculation about Edge possibly continuing his in-ring career elsewhere.

Shortly after the Sheamus bout, PWTorch's Wade Keller reported that Edge ""presented to WWE what it would take to retain his services, but WWE declined to meet his request.""

Keller added that the expectation from people within WWE was that The Rated-R Superstar would leave the company and sign with AEW where he would potentially finish up his in-ring career at the age of 49.

The WWE Hall of Famer refuted the report shortly thereafter, posting a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he said the following:

""There's nothing going on. There's no hard feelings between me and WWE. I love WWE, it's my dream gig. It's all I ever wanted to do. I didn't come at them with some crazy contract or anything, they didn't deny me. I have a contract extension sitting in my inbox, I just don't know what to do.""

While Edge didn't deny or even address the possibility of signing with AEW, he dismissed the idea that WWE had turned down his requests.

Edge seemed open to potentially signing a new deal with WWE, but he also suggested that retiring from in-ring competition was on the table due to his belief that it would be tough to top the match against Sheamus in his hometown.

It is unclear if the changing of Edge's status on the internal roster says anything about his status with the company, especially considering his contract is set to expire in a couple of weeks.

On one hand, it could be a case of WWE doing some internal housekeeping in anticipation of Edge's deal reaching its conclusion, or it could be a sign that WWE has signed him to a different type of deal, such as a legends contract.

Still, speculation of a move to AEW will likely continue until and unless Edge says otherwise, especially since he is closely linked to several members of the AEW roster, including longtime friend Christian Cage.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
89,"Title: Backstage WWE and AEW Rumors: Latest on Jade Cargill, Nia Jax and More","1 of 4

Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful Select reported that former TBS champion Jade Cargill is wrapping up her AEW run and is expected to sign with WWE.

""(As) things stand at this moment, Cargill is finishing up with AEW, with the September 13 tapings in Cincinnati possibly being her last appearance,"" Sapp said.

Cargill challenges Kris Statlander for the TBS Championship Friday night on Rampage.

Sapp added: ""Fightful has spoken to sources within both AEW and WWE that believe she is headed to WWE. We should specify that we haven't heard of an official offer being made, and as is always the case, things can change in the world of pro wrestling, including a situation like this.""

He specified that there is no word on exactly what or how much time is left on Cargill's deal but there may be option years in play.

If the 31-year-old is finished with AEW and heads to WWE, it would be a huge fumble for Tony Khan and Co.

From the moment she set foot in AEW, Cargill has exuded superstardom. Her charisma and presence made up for her lack of experience and carried her through a historic run as the inaugural TBS champion.

Unfortunately, it became clear midway through the title reign that there was little in the way of creative for her as Cargill found herself on a booking treadmill, routinely winning but enjoying little in the way of substance.

Should she make her way to WWE, the major marketing machine behind her would be an upgrade. She would also have time to learn and evolve as a worker, depending on how quickly the company would want to debut her on television.

Working with the likes of Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair, Bianca Belair, Bayley and Asuka would only help her develop her skills while reaching her full potential.

It is a fluid situation, and Sapp conceded that the ""wide rumor"" is that Cargill will join WWE.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
90,Title: 7 UFC Fighters Who Could Thrive in WWE,"0 of 7

Michelle Farsi/Zuffa LLC

Earlier this week, a host of UFC and WWE executives converged on the New York Stock Exchange to commemorate a high-profile merger between the two companies.

This landmark deal could be extremely beneficial for both and creates a number of interesting business opportunities, most notably, talent-sharing between them.

We've seen plenty of fighters move between the UFC and WWE in the past. Several former UFC stars have tried their hand at pro wrestling—including Ronda Rousey—while the likes of Brock Lesnar and CM Punk went the opposite direction with differing levels of success.

Now that the UFC and WWE are part of the same company, we're likely to see many more athletes moving between the Octagon and the ring. In fact, executives are already talking about it.

""UFC fighters are going to stay focused on the UFC, and WWE superstars obviously do something different in our ring,"" WWE president Nick Khan told ESPN this week. ""... But you also see in the UFC people with big personalities who, once their UFC run is done, once the UFC and the fighter says, 'Hey, maybe now's the time to call it a day,' could those people have a longer life at WWE, an extended life with TKO? We think so.""",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
91,Title: WWE's Cameron Grimes Says 'I Would Like to to Fight in the UFC' Following TKO Merger,"Source: WWE.com

Now that WWE and UFC are officially operating under the same banner, at least one WWE superstar might look to crossover into mixed martial arts.

Grimes wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, he ""would like to fight in the UFC.""

On Tuesday, Endeavor and WWE closed the previously-announced deal that joined the wrestling company and UFC together to create TKO Group Holdings.

It's not unheard of for a pro wrestler to venture into mixed martial arts. Brock Lesnar is the most successful person to ever go from WWE to MMA as a former UFC heavyweight champion and headliner of some of the biggest shows in the promotion's history.

CM Punk dabbled in it with two UFC fights in 2016 and 2018, going 0-1 with one no contest. Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler went the other way by moving into professional wrestling after their MMA careers ended.

Lesnar had a unique skill set because he was a high-level athlete and won a national championship as a college wrestler at Minnesota.

Unless Grimes has any formal training in a mixed martial arts discipline, he might find it difficult to land a UFC fight. He might find it easier to work with UFC fighters now that the company is a partner with WWE.

For now, Grimes can continue to carve out his own niche as a member of the SmackDown roster. He's been used sparingly since being added to the blue brand during the 2023 draft. His highest-profile match was the battle royal at SummerSlam won by LA Knight.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
92,Title: Bad Bunny Eyes Roman Reigns; WWE's Khan Talks CM Punk; Latest on Triple H's Future,"Gladys Vega/ Getty Images

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Bad Bunny Wants Match vs. Roman Reigns

Bad Bunny has made a massive impact in limited appearances as a part-time attraction for WWE, and he has his sights set on what would be the biggest match of his career thus far.

In an interview with Michelle Ruiz of Vanity Fair, the Grammy Award-winning musician suggested that he wants to mix it up with the undisputed WWE universal champion of the past three years, saying: ""My plan is to take the title from Roman Reigns.""

Bad Bunny has only had a handful of matches, making his in-ring debut at WrestleMania 37 in 2021, winning a tag team match alongside Damian Priest over The Miz and John Morrison.

More recently, Bad Bunny competed in his home country of Puerto Rico at Backlash in May, defeating Priest in a San Juan Street Fight thanks to help from the LWO and Puerto Rican wrestling legends Carlito and Savio Vega.

While Bad Bunny has had plenty of help along the way and has benefited from proverbial bells and whistles being added to his matches, he has impressed every chance he has gotten.

A big reason for that is likely his genuine love for pro wrestling, as he is a longtime fan and told Ruiz what he enjoys about it, noting: ""I liked everything—the creativity, the characters, the fact that each wrestler has his own entrance song, like a soundtrack that identifies you.""

Reigns is the face of WWE and one of the most dominant world champions of all time, having held a world title for over 1,000 days consecutively.

The Tribal Chief doesn't typically go up against novice wrestlers like Bad Bunny, but it won't be the first time if it does come to fruition.

In just the second singles match of his career, Logan Paul faced Reigns at Crown Jewel last year, and the bout was widely praised for how entertaining and exciting it was.

Reigns would likely be able to pull off something similar with Bad Bunny, so it won't be a shock if they do lock horns eventually.

Nick Khan Thanks Punk for Time in WWE

Amid speculation regarding CM Punk possibly returning to WWE following his AEW release, WWE president Nick Khan discussed the former WWE and AEW world champion this week.

ESPN's Marc Raimondi (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News) asked Khan about WWE's potential interest in Punk, and he gave something of a non-answer, saying:

""Listen, we only have respect for Phil [Brooks aka Punk]. We appreciate his run here. We appreciate what he did and tried to do with the UFC. Not many people can actually get in there and do what he did. So, when we have respect for Phil, we wish him nothing but the best.""

Khan gave no indication whether WWE has any intention to speak to Punk, which isn't particularly surprising since that type of move would likely be kept under wraps even if it were to happen.

Additionally, WWE and UFC officially merged this week into a singular company, meaning executives like Khan are primarily focused elsewhere at the moment.

Punk was a multi-time world champion and huge star in WWE before walking out in January 2014. He stayed out of wrestling for over seven years before making his return with AEW in 2021.

His run in AEW was plagued by injuries and controversies, as he reportedly got into backstage altercations with the likes of Kenny Omega, The Young Bucks and ""Jungle Boy"" Jack Perry.

A reported tussle with Perry at All In was the final straw and led directly to Punk's AEW contract getting terminated.

It isn't clear if there is any type of mutual interest between Punk and WWE, but if Punk wants to continue wrestling at a high level, WWE may be his only option.

Bringing in Punk typically would have been a Vince McMahon decision in the past, but many more people would be involved in such a decision post-merger, and since Punk has history in both WWE and UFC, it isn't outside the realm of possibility that something could get worked out.

Triple H Remains Head of Creative After WWE Merger

Despite the merger of WWE and UFC into a new company called TKO, there won't be a significant change to the role of one of WWE's primary decision-makers.

According to Raimondi, Khan said Triple H will remain in his current position as WWE head of creative and chief content officer.

Those are roles Triple H has held since the summer of 2022 when Vince McMahon stepped down as WWE's head of creative, chairman and CEO.

McMahon returned in January to facilitate the sale of WWE to Endeavor Group Holdings, and he is now the executive chairman of TKO, but Triple H's job title is unchanged.

Since McMahon's return in January, rumors have persisted that he has had a hand in creative decisions and at times made changes to the Raw and SmackDown scripts remotely.

McMahon went on medical leave in July after undergoing spinal surgery, but Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t F4WOnline's Joseph Currier) reported that McMahon made changes to this week's episode of Raw and has been part of the creative process for weeks.

It remains unclear precisely how much input McMahon has on a weekly basis and whether he has final authority over creative decisions, but Triple H is undoubtedly a significant part of the creative process regardless.

WWE has long been a collaborative effort from a creative standpoint, and that is likely still the case, but in terms of decision-makers who are present backstage at Raw and SmackDown, it sounds like Triple H will continue to be the point man moving forward.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
93,"Title: The Judgment Day Shock Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn to Win WWE Tag Titles at Payback 2023","Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

Judgment Day members Damian Priest and Finn Bálor defeated Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn in a Steel City Street Fight at Payback on Saturday to win the undisputed WWE Tag Team Championships.

This electric match included Owens sporting a Mario Lemieux jersey and hitting a swanton bomb onto Dominik Mysterio:

However, interference from Mysterio and Rhea Ripley ultimately led to The Judgment Day reigning supreme on the night.

Bálor pinned Zayn for the win after Mysterio hit Zayn with the Money in the Bank briefcase.

In recent weeks, The Judgment Day have set out to show that they run Raw, and on the occasions that Owens and Zayn stood in their way, they attempted to put both on the shelf.

They succeeded in injuring KO, causing him to miss SummerSlam, and while Zayn continued to fight against The Judgment Day during his teammate's absence, he did so at far less than 100 percent.

Prior to a scheduled six-man tag team match that would have pitted Zayn, Seth Rollins and Cody Rhodes against The Judgment Day, Sami was attacked backstage by Judgment Day ally JD McDonagh and suffered an elbow injury.

The ailment rendered Zayn unable to compete that night, but he bounced back quickly and continued to oppose The Judgment Day until Owens returned to action after being out for about one month.

On the go-home episode of Raw prior to Payback, Zayn faced Priest in a singles match, which The Archer of Infamy won due to interference from McDonagh.

Priest was unhappy despite the win since he didn't want the Irishman to get involved with Judgment Day business, further driving a wedge between him and Bálor since The Prince has long been friends with JD.

Frustrated by Judgement Day members and McDonagh constantly interjecting themselves into their matches, Owens and Zayn upped the ante for their scheduled title defense against Priest and Bálor at Payback.

Rather than simply making it a standard tag team match, KO and Sami challenged the faction to a Steel City Street Fight, meaning their bout would be anything goes.

Despite the divide within The Judgment Day, Priest and Bálor rose to the occasion and each became a tag team champion for the first time in their WWE careers.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
94,"Title: Triple H, Nick Khan, Kevin Dunn's Bonus Money Revealed After WWE's Merger with UFC","Jerod Harris/Getty Images

Multiple key members of WWE's management team received significant bonuses following the merger of WWE and UFC into a singular company known as TKO Group Holdings this week.

According to Steve Carrier of Ringside News, WWE disclosed that chief content officer Triple H will receive $5 million, president Nick Khan will receive $15 million and executive producer Kevin Dunn will receive $7 million.

Vince McMahon purchased WWE from his father in 1982 and remained the primary owner or shareholder in the company for over 40 years before agreeing to sell the bulk of the company to Endeavor Group Holdings in April.

Now, WWE is embarking on a new era, as a McMahon is not fully in charge for the first time in the company's history.

McMahon will be a key part of TKO moving forward, however, as he is the executive chairman, which suggests he will continue to make important decisions or at least have plenty of input on the wrestling side of things.

Triple H is WWE's head of creative, which is a role he inherited from McMahon when Vince retired in the summer of 2022, only to return in January 2023 to facilitate a sale of the company.

The WWE Hall of Famer remains in that position, and is most often the main person in charge backstage at WWE events such as Raw, SmackDown and premium live events.

WWE hired Khan, a former agent, in 2020, and every indication is that he played a huge role in making the sale of the company happen.

Meanwhile, Dunn has been one of McMahon's right-hand men and the head of production for WWE for decades, and there are no signs of his role changing in the near future.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

For months during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tampa's Tropicana Field played host to the WWE ThunderDome.

Now the Tampa Bay Rays' stadium is set to host a fan-packed Royal Rumble.

WWE announced Tropicana Field as the host of the 2024 Royal Rumble on Wednesday, a day after Endeavor's deal to purchase a majority stake in the company was finalized.

""We are excited to welcome WWE back to Tropicana Field for the 2024 Royal Rumble,"" said Tampa Bay Rays President Matt Silverman. ""The Royal Rumble will provide first-class sports entertainment to both those seeing the action in person and watching as part of a worldwide television audience. This event will bring visitors from around the globe to experience the beauty of our area and all it has to offer.""

Tampa's Raymond James Stadium played host to WrestleMania 37 in April 2021, which marked the first event with fans since the beginning of the pandemic.

WWE is in the midst of a massive business and creative boom. Last year's Royal Rumble was the highest-grossing Royal Rumble in company history, generating $7.7 million in gate revenue.

Profit will be even more vital as WWE sets sail on the new TKO Holdings Group venture alongside UFC. Endeavor's majority stake purchase of the wrestling giant set a valuation of $9.3 billion on the company, and the launch of TKO with UFC created a $21 billion endeavor.

UFC president Dana White confirmed a longstanding rumor this week that then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon declined to buy UFC in the early 2000s despite pitches from his son, Shane McMahon, to do so.

During an appearance on Big Boy TV (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News), White discussed what he knew of the McMahons considering the possibility of purchasing UFC in the past:

""Vince McMahon, from what I hear, his son Shane wanted to buy the UFC. Vince had the opportunity to buy it. And Vince said, 'Yeah. No. We're not gonna buy it.' Vince could have bought this thing and just put it on the shelf. Or Vince could have bought it and let his son [run it].""

UFC had something of a cult following in the 1990s and into the early 2000s, but it eventually exploded and became the biggest and most successful combat sports organization in the world.

WWE had some links to UFC previously, including signing a former UFC star in Ken Shamrock to a pro wrestling contract, but White's story suggests that Vince McMahon didn't see enough value in buying it.

In 2001, McMahon bought longtime pro wrestling competitor WCW, and another competitor in ECW went out of business as well. WWE eventually purchased ECW's video library and intellectual property.

UFC was not and still isn't a direct competitor to WWE, but if McMahon had purchased it, the decision could have changed the course of combat sports and professional wrestling forever.

Ironically, WWE and UFC are now under the same umbrella, as the two entities officially merged into a singular company called TKO Group Holdings this week.

Earlier this year, UFC owner Endeavor Group Holdings purchased WWE, marking the first time a McMahon has not had the controlling interest in WWE.

97,Title: Fantasy Booking a CM Punk Return to WWE,"Credit: All Elite Wrestling

CM Punk's release from All Elite Wrestling created one obvious and intriguing question regarding his future in professional wrestling: What might his return to WWE look like?

Punk left that promotion on anything but good terms back in 2014, but time (and money) can heal all wounds. Throw in his positive relationship with new majority owners, Endeavor, dating back to his time with UFC and you have the foundation for a potential return.

When you factor in a ready-made angle that would play off WWE's most prominent, overarching storyline, it becomes even more obvious that company officials should do their due diligence in terms of bringing the 44-year-old back into the fold.

A Paul Heyman Guy

Punk's infamous ""pipebomb"" promo in June 2011 saw him describe himself as a ""Paul Heyman guy."" Fast-forward a year later and the Chicago native underwent a heel turn that brought The Wise Man into his circle as manager/special counsel/advocate.

Heyman would stand by Punk's side for a year before a heel turn ignited a feud between The Best in the World and Brock Lesnar, and therein lies the motivation for the former WWE champion's return to the promotion.

Imagine at Survivor Series, in Chicago appropriately enough, undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns has just successfully retained his title and stands triumphantly in the squared circle alongside Heyman.

The Tribal Chief boldly claims he has conquered everyone, only to be interrupted by Living Colour's ""Cult of Personality"" as Punk walks through the curtain to a thunderous ovation.

An unnamed user made the below edit, giving an idea of what that might look like.

Heyman's reaction is key because, if anyone knows what Punk's return means and the threat it provides Reigns, it is him. He watched Punk, studied him, and knows damn well that outside of his other famous client Lesnar, he is the last guy to hold the WWE title for any significant length of time.

He knows Punk can beat Reigns, but he also knows his former associate can drive a wedge between The Head of the Table and The Wise Man, potentially ruining the enormously successful run that Heyman has been on over the last three years.

See, Punk was in Reigns' shoes, aligning himself with Heyman and allowing the godfather of extreme to come along for the ride in a monumental championship reign, only to be betrayed the moment a better opportunity came along.

A scenario where Punk cuts a promo warning Reigns of that, telling him Heyman is a leech who latches onto anyone even remotely successful and uses them for his own benefit before leaving them when the next thing comes along, would be perfect and based in what we already know to be true.

He can even plant the seeds of dissension, asking Reigns how he knows Punk and Heyman are not working together to dethrone The Tribal Chief right now. After all, the writing is on the wall, The Bloodline is crumbling, and it is only a matter of time before The Head of the Table loses his spot.

The potential is even there to turn Reigns babyface for the first time in three years, with Punk's warning proving to be accurate as he and Heyman conspire to screw Reigns out of the title.

Regardless of what direction the program takes, it would be must-see television and generate a big-money match for one of the company's most prominent pay-per-views.

It would also bring a top-tier star back into the fold on the Road to WrestleMania 40, something WWE never misses the opportunity to do as it typically creates buzz surrounding its most important show.

Add in the fact that the company is run like a business and the locker room is at least outwardly less volatile and more professional than others, and you have a better environment Punk can excel in.

The good outweighs the bad at this point and if issues present themselves, WWE can put itself in a position contractually to make sure there is little in the way of risk if it has to cut the cord early.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
98,"Title: WWE Rumors on Nia Jax's Return, Vince McMahon Back in Creative and LA Knight Contract","Rich Graessle/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Latest on Nia Jax's WWE Return

The end of Raw saw the surprise return of Nia Jax, who inserted herself into the women's world title picture by attacking Raquel Rodriguez during her main-event match against Rhea Ripley on Monday night.

After Ripley hit Rodriguez with the rip-tide for the pin to retain the title, Jax went after the champion with a headbutt, leg drop and banzai drop.

Per Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), Jax signed with WWE more than one month ago as the first major addition since Vince McMahon came back to the company earlier this year:

""Fightful Select had noted on recent shows that we'd heard she was headed back to the company, and we're told she's been signed over a month, and that the hiring freeze effectively was ended this summer.

""She's the first signing that was made since Vince McMahon forced his way back into the company that returned on Main Roster TV. The Endeavor-WWE merger is happening this week, but we're told it's unrelated to her popping up on TV. Several within the company actually thought she'd return before this.""

Jax was released from WWE amid a series of roster cuts in November 2021. She had been with the company since 2014 and was involved in several high-profile feuds, including against Ronda Rousey in 2018.

Given the lack of depth on the Raw women's roster, Ripley certainly needed new challengers. Her list of opponents since beating Charlotte Flair at WrestleMania 39 includes Rodriguez, Candice LeRae, Indi Hartwell, Natalya, Zelina Vega and Lyra Valkyria.

While there are good wrestlers in that group, none of them have ever been pushed like a top star. Jax is a limited in-ring worker, but she was often booked like a main-eventer during her previous run.

Vince McMahon Made Changes to Raw

It appears Vince McMahon is recovering well after undergoing spinal surgery earlier this summer.

Per Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Radio (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News), Vince McMahon made ""significant"" changes to Monday's Raw throughout the day before the show went on the air even though he wasn't at the arena in Virginia:

""So if the show was–a lot of stuff wasn't advertised on the show, most of it, and the reason is they were changing all day long. But Vince is back, Vince made significant changes to the show and I don't know what the changes were, all I heard was they were probably changes for the better but there were many of them.

""But Vince is back from his surgery leave, he was not in the chair, he was not [at the show], but he was involved in the production of the show.""

There wasn't a lot advertised for the show ahead of time. The Ripley-Rodriguez match, Gunther's celebration of becoming the longest-reigning intercontinental champion of all-time and a Cody Rhodes segment were all that was known.

All three things did happen, which is a vast improvement from the years when McMahon was changing things so often that advertised matches wound up not taking place on Raw or SmackDown.

Meltzer also noted that Triple H, who is WWE's chief content officer, made ""multiple changes"" to the show at the last minute.

McMahon's return comes after WWE announced earlier this summer he had ""pretty intensive"" spinal surgery. He had been on medical leave as a result of the procedure.

The 78-year-old's return also coincides with the expected closing of the merger between WWE and UFC on Tuesday.

Update on LA Knight's Contract Talks

Amid a recent report that LA Knight was nearing a new deal with WWE, it appears things may not be as close as initially believed.

Per Sapp (h/t Upton), no deal has been agreed on between Knight and WWE with the two sides ""far apart on money"" at this point.



PW Insider reported on Sept. 7 (h/t Upton) that Knight and WWE had either completed a new five-year deal or were close to doing so.

In the most recent issue of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t SEScoops.com), Meltzer noted Knight was ""expected to get a megapush going forward given that the ratings for his segments and his merchandise sales have both been very strong.""

Even though it doesn't appear as if Knight has a new contract right now, Sapp noted there's no truth to the idea that a push is tied to him signing a deal and his current contract ""runs well into 2025, and has over a year and a half left on it.""

Knight has emerged as one of the key superstars for WWE this year. He's one of the best talkers in the company and is starting to get high-profile matches on television.

Given how valuable Knight has made himself, it would seem likely a contract gets worked out at some point. There doesn't have to be a rush to get it done now since he's signed for all of next year and at least a part of 2025.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,yes

Vince McMahon officially no longer holds majority control of WWE.

Endeavor officially completed its majority-stake purchase of the wrestling giant Tuesday, merging WWE with UFC to create TKO Group Holdings.

Shares in the company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the opening bell Tuesday, opening at a price of $102 per share.

Endeavor owns 51 percent of the newly formed company. McMahon owns 16.4 percent of TKO under terms of the deal. Endeavor agreed to a deal to acquire a majority stake in WWE in April. The deal placed a $9.3 billion valuation on the world's largest professional wrestling company. As part of the deal, Endeavor agreed to spin off UFC and create a $21 billion combat sports behemoth.

McMahon has owned a controlling stake in WWE since purchasing the company from his father in 1982. The 78-year-old transformed the business, taking it from its regional base and turning it into a national phenomenon.

""The creation of TKO marks an exciting new chapter for UFC and WWE as leaders in global sports and entertainment,"" Endeavor CEO Ariel Emanuel said in a statement. ""Given their continued connectivity to the Endeavor network, we are confident in our ability to accelerate their respective growth and unlock long-term sustainable value for shareholders. With UFC and WWE under one roof, we will provide unrivaled experiences for more than a billion passionate fans worldwide.""

While there have been ebbs and flows, McMahon has found a way to stabilize WWE and ensure it remains atop of the sport. The 1990s challenge from WCW provided fierce competition and AEW's ascent over the last decade has done the same, but WWE is far and away the most valuable promotion on the planet.

McMahon is staying on as executive chairman of TKO holdings and is expected to remain involved in WWE creative decisions. Paul Levesque, better known as Triple H, will remain WWE's head of creative.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Gunther is officially the longest-reigning intercontinental champion in WWE history, and he could also be considered the top heel on Raw.

Feuding with The Ring General is a serious opportunity, and Tommaso Ciampa looks like he is getting that chance.



Since The Blackheart got the main roster call-up, he has struggled to find his footing. A serious hip injury kept him off television for eight months, but he has hardly been featured even when healthy.



Recently, Ciampa teased bringing back in Johnny Gargano, who has had even less TV time of late. First, though, he looks poised to challenge Gunther.



This is an important crossroads for Ciampa. He is 38 years old and dealt with serious injuries in his career, and he may not get many more big chances to shine.



A match with the IC titleholder is a chance to put on the biggest match of his career. He needs time to shine in the build as well as the match itself. More importantly, he needs to make his minutes count.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

""Main Event"" Jey Uso kicked things off this week, but he didn't get to say much before Kevin Owens slowly made his way to the ring.

KO said he made a lot of mistakes and spent a long time trying to earn back everyone's respect, but now he has people who don't even respect him telling him that Jey doesn't belong on Raw. He told Jey he has a long way to go before he proves he has changed.

The Judgment Day came out and said Owens doesn't speak for the locker room because they respect Jey. Damian Priest told him the door is always open if he wanted to join the group. He brought up Dominik being a champion as proof that joining the stable can help.

Jey suggested he and KO team up to fight The Judgment Day since Sami Zayn wasn't at the Scope Arena. The Prizefighter accepted, and they immediately started brawling.

The match was made official during the break and started when the show resumed.

Dom sat this one out while Finn Bálor and Priest worked the match. This was a solid tag team bout that did a good job making it clear that Jey and KO don't have the same chemistry as they do with Jimmy Uso and Zayn, respectively.

Jey accidentally hit Owens with a superkick and paved the way for Bálor to hit the Coup de Grace for the win.

The announcers did a great job laying out why this ending is going to make it harder for Jey to earn anyone's respect.

102,"Title: Drew McIntyre on CM Punk; Jim Ross Talks Edge, AEW Buzz; WWE Rumors on Gable Steveson","Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe and All Elite Wrestling.

McIntyre Calls Punk Controversial

In the wake of CM Punk's termination from AEW, there has been a great deal of speculation among fans regarding Punk potentially making his WWE return and competing for the company for the first time since January 2014.

While there isn't yet any concrete evidence that there is mutual interest between the two sides, it is likely that talk will persist for as long as Punk remains a free agent.

That has led to some current WWE Superstars being asked to give their thoughts about the possibility of Punk returning.

Among them was Drew McIntyre, who said the following about Punk while speaking to Riju Dasgupta of SportsKeeda Wrestling (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News): ""I mean, I don't make those decisions. I watch what I say in interviews. But he's [CM Punk] certainly controversial and he gets people talking. So, I'll leave it at that.""

Punk didn't leave WWE on positive terms in 2014, but after more than seven years away from wrestling, he returned as part of AEW in 2021, and hopes were high regarding how far he could potentially take the upstart company.

While Punk increased ratings, helped sell out events, had some great matches and rivalries, and won the AEW World Championship twice, his time with the promotion was largely tumultuous.

Punk was reportedly involved in multiple backstage dust-ups, and the decision was made to part ways with him after he and ""Jungle Boy"" Jack Perry reportedly got into it backstage at All In at Wembley Stadium in London.

If Punk wants to continue wrestling, he doesn't have many realistic options outside of WWE, so he will continue to be linked to his former employer moving forward.

WWE is enjoying a great deal of financial success and doesn't necessarily need Punk, but there is little doubt that he would add even more intrigue to the product.

Ross Doesn't Expect Edge in AEW

Despite rumors to the contrary, AEW announcer Jim Ross does not anticipate WWE Hall of Famer Edge to sign with AEW.

Last month, Edge faced Sheamus on an episode of SmackDown in his hometown of Toronto. Edge announced that it would be his final match in Toronto and said it was also the final match on his WWE contract, which expires at the end of September.

This led to speculation that Edge could potentially opt to sign with AEW, and the whispers grew louder when PWTorch's Wade Keller reported that Edge ""presented to WWE what it would take to retain his services, but WWE declined to meet his request.""

Keller followed that up by noting that people within WWE expected Edge to sign with AEW due to the two sides being unable to reach an agreement.

Shortly thereafter, Edge posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he refuted the report:

Edge denied that WWE had rejected his requests and said he had a contract offer from the company in his inbox. He also suggested that he was considering retirement due to his belief that it would be tough to top his match with Sheamus in Toronto.

Even so, there has continued to be plenty of talk among fans about Edge going to AEW, but JR does not personally see it happening.

Speaking on his Grilling JR podcast (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), Ross said he hasn't heard talk from anyone within AEW about Edge joining the company, and he also doubted the likelihood of it happening:

""You know, out of all the time I spent around talent at All Out weekend, not one of them ever mentioned to me about [Edge] coming in. Maybe at the after-party, I don't know, I didn't go to that, but yeah, it would be great, but I haven't given it much thought.

""I mean, but how about Edge vs Kenny Omega, Edge vs Will Ospreay. There are many ways you can capitalize on this, but I haven't heard anything. I don't even know if it's feasible. I have heard through the grapevine that WWE has an offer on the table for him. It is a significant one, as it should be. I don't know, but it's a long shot at best that [Edge] comes to work for AEW. I signed him and Christian on the same day back in the day, with their grandiose salary of $200 a week.""

Of course, Edge has some significant links to AEW with Christian Cage being the biggest one, as they are lifelong friends who came into WWE together and were one of the greatest tag teams of all time.

Additionally, Edge is close with FTR members Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler, who could potentially help draw him to AEW as well.

Edge is nearing the end of his spectacular career at 49 years of age, but whichever company signs him should still be able to squeeze a few more great rivalries and matches out of him.

No Current NXT Plans Reportedly in Place for Steveson

Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler Gable Steveson remains under contract with WWE, but there are reportedly no immediate plans for him to appear on television again in the near future.

According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Radio (h/t Upton), Steveson beat Dante Chen at a pair of NXT house shows last week, but as of now, there are no plans for him on NXT TV.

The 23-year-old Steveson signed with WWE in 2021 shortly after he won Olympic gold in freestyle wrestling. Meltzer reported that there were initially big plans for him to debut on the main roster, but WWE pumped the brakes and sent him to NXT instead.

Steveson began making NXT appearances over the summer, and he made his in-ring debut at the Great American Bash in July, fighting Baron Corbin to a double count-out.

The crowd did not receive Steveson well, which could potentially be part of the reason why WWE decided to pull him from NXT programming.

Per Meltzer, Steveson has a fairly significant contract due to WWE's belief that he was going to be the company's next Brock Lesnar, but it hasn't happened yet.

There was some thought that Steveson would go back to amateur wrestling and attempt to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, but he is no longer listed as competing at the world championships after initially being part of the Team USA roster.

That could mean Steveson is focusing solely on WWE moving forward, but the company seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach before making more substantial plans for him.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

It would be easy to argue against Reigns because of his reduced schedule, lack of championship defenses or the perception that he does not work as hard as a Seth Rollins or a Cody Rhodes.

Easy, but misguided.

Reigns is still the centerpiece of WWE, and his epic storyline—encompassing the Sami Zayn ""Honorary Uce"" chapter and the dismantling of The Bloodline by way of his feud with Jey Uso—has resulted in enormous television ratings.

The July 7 episode of SmackDown, featuring The Tribal Trial of Reigns, was the first time in history that professional wrestling was the most-watched show on all of television, per Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.

Throughout 2023, he has elevated those he has worked with. Zayn and Kevin Owens were bigger stars for having worked with The Tribal Chief, so much so that they headlined Night 1 of WrestleMania 39 and won the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship from The Usos.

Speaking of the twins, Jimmy and Jey are amid singles runs that would not have existed had there not been the overarching Bloodline story. The latter brother is particularly benefitting as one of the top babyfaces in the company.

Three hugely dramatic main events (against Zayn, Cody Rhodes and Jey), countless engaging segments and some of the best attention to detail from a performance standpoint are enough for Reigns to earn the MVP recognition.

Factor in what he has done for the business as a whole by creating moments that people want to see, and you have a guy who can work whatever schedule he wants. Especially when everything he is a part of is so significant to WWE and its stars as a whole.

Rhodes had a hot, months-spanning feud with Brock Lesnar that helped him get back on track to the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The Usos are hotter individual stars than they have ever been. Rollins is the world heavyweight champion, a title created so Raw had its own prize while Reigns dominates on the blue brand. Zayn and Owens are mega-over and helped enhance the tag division.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

It was added that WWE will soon him have internally slotted as the top babyface on SmackDown, which should come as no surprise based on his strong crowd reaction, social media metrics, merchandise and more.

That would have to make a match between him and Reigns inevitable.

As previously noted, The Tribal Chief's schedule for the remainder of 2023 is up in the air and no upcoming title defenses are set in stone. If he is on track to lose the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 40, it would be booking malpractice for these two to collide for the title sometime before then.

She is seeking unspecified damages plus at least $150,000 per violation of the federal law prohibiting the sharing of intimate images.

Per TMZ, the lawsuit goes on to state that Agdal has ""suffered humiliation, emotional distress, and reputational harm"" and includes an allegation that one post made by Danis on Aug. 11 violated federal and state law. The post included ""a sexually explicit image of her that was taken from 'a romantic encounter' she had"" with someone over 10 years ago.

""Danis posted the photograph -- entirely uncensored -- from his X (Twitter) account, without Plaintiff's consent,"" Agdal stated in the suit. ""Later that day, Danis reposted the explicit photograph in order to maximize the number of views it would receive.""

Agdal further stated that Danis only agreed to delete the post after the Misfits Boxing promotion threatened to cancel his Oct. 14 fight against Paul if he didn't take it down.

106,"Title: Ranking Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn, FTR and the Best Tag Teams in WWE and AEW Today","2 of 3

Credit: WWE.com

WWE has a long history of utilizing its tag division as a plot device rather than a showcase of tag team wrestling. It has long taken two established, over singles wrestlers and thrown them together in an attempt to further storytelling, often at the expense of the actual teams.

It is a pattern that gained popularity within its creative team during the Attitude Era and has persisted since and today is no different.

Yes, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn have a long history as a team, dating back to their time on the indies but in the eyes of the WWE Universe, they are another instance of guys who have long been established as singles stars coming together to succeed in the tag team wrestling.

Ditto Judgment Day's Finn Balor and Damian Priest.

Meanwhile, there are talented tandems such as Alpha Academy's Chad Gable and Otis, Imperium's Ludwig Kaiser and Giovanni Vinci, Pretty Deadly's Elton Prince and Kit Wilson, and the surprisingly undervalued Viking Raiders' Erik and Ivar, all of whom are capable of tearing it up and adding credibility to the division.

The closest thing we have gotten was the prime run of The New Day and The Usos when they were battling every week for tag team supremacy. Even then, WWE failed to build legitimate teams around them and if it did, it was typically one or two others, leading to repetitive matches rather than a roster of duos that could all convincingly win the gold.

Unfortunately, that does not appear to be changing any time soon.

Owens and Zayn and The Judgment Day are great for elevating the stature of the tag titles and gives them a realistic opportunity to headline Raw and SmackDown, but without any real teams to work with that can genuinely beat them, it ultimately is another instance of tag team wrestling taking a backseat to the individual stars.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
107,Title: Expectations for John Cena's WWE SmackDown Run after Win at Superstar Spectacle 2023,"Michael Loccisano/Getty Images

After John Cena and Seth Rollins beat Imperium's Giovanni Vinci and Ludwig Kaiser at WWE Superstar Spectacle in India, wrestling fans have turned their attention toward what's next for the 16-time world champion.

While letting Cena grace an international show the magnitude of Superstar Spectacle is a smart business move for WWE, the company's creative team must use the Hollywood star's credibility with the fans to help put over at least one current performer before his inevitable departure.

At Payback, Cena was involved in a match as a special guest referee between LA Knight and The Miz, which could be setting up a potential tag team or multi-man bout for a future event.

With Austin Theory and Grayson Waller showing signs of forming an alliance, Cena could find an unlikely tag team partner with Knight in his battle against the heel tandem.

Not only would Cena help Knight stay red hot with the WWE universe, but he would also showcase the supreme talent of Waller, who has all the potential in the world to be a better version of The Miz.

Add in Cena's history with Theory, and the potential for a feud is obvious.

In addition, if the company wants to expand the program, incorporating The Miz on the heel team and Rey Mysterio—an old friend of Cena—on the face team, WWE would have a six-man match worthy of any stage or premium live event.

There is a large contingent of wrestling fans who also look at Cena's 16 runs with a world heavyweight championship and can't help but think the company will eventually let him surpass Ric Flair's record and win another world title.

With Roman Reigns standing tall as the Tribal Chief on SmackDown and Seth Rollins trying to establish himself and a new title on Raw, now is not the time to have the living legend break the record.

Instead, WWE should wait for a heel to win the championship and create a reign of terror, only for Cena to triumphantly return ahead of WrestleMania and steal back the title for the good guys. He could then quickly lose the belt back to another up-and-coming heel, making him one of the most marquee transitional champions in history and giving the company an unforgettable moment that it could bank off financially for years to come.

As a staple of the SmackDown brand for the next several weeks, or at least until the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike, Cena's top priority must be to make the current performers on television every week look strong, going against everything he has done during his career to bury the hottest talents and vampire their momentum away.

If WWE is dead set on having Cena fight for a world championship, he should battle against The Bloodline, setting aside Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa before getting another crack at Reigns. He should not be the one to defeat the Head of the Table, but another high-profile win over a bona fide legend would further cement Reigns' current run as one of the best in wrestling history.

No matter what Triple H and WWE Creative have in store for Cena over the next two months, his time on television must not be squandered. Too many performers could use the rub, and too many storylines that could use his impact on the company to waste his credibility.

Whether wrestling fans like Cena or not—based on his years of using his clout to get what he wants—his presence is undeniable and the impact he could make on the current product should be felt long after he returns to Hollywood.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Another WrestleMania main event involving Roman Reigns is all but guaranteed for the upcoming installment in April 2024. It's more a matter of who his opponent will end up being.

If he can maintain his possession of the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship until then, he will become the first Superstar to walk into WrestleMania with the same title four years in a row. Hulk Hogan was the only other person to do it with three.

Of course, it won't be difficult for him to hold onto it if his title defenses are far and few between. He last defended the prestigious prize against Jey Uso at SummerSlam, and before that, you'd have to go all the way back to WrestleMania 39 when he beat Cody Rhodes to retain the title.

Despite rumors and speculation that he could be AEW bound once his contract expires, WWE Hall of Famer Edge was included in the new SmackDown intro Friday night.

Edge is shown prominently at the 27-second mark of the intro, which begs the question of whether he would be included if WWE officials thought he planned to go elsewhere:

The Rated-R Superstar himself confirmed last month on The FAN Morning Show (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News) that his WWE contract expires at the end of September.

He had also previously stated that the bout against Sheamus on the Aug. 18 episode in his hometown of Toronto was the final match on his current contract.

Shortly thereafter, PWTorch's Wade Keller reported that Edge ""presented to WWE what it would take to retain his services, but WWE declined to meet his request.""

It was also reported that Edge likely already had knowledge of what kind of deal he could get with AEW, and that people within WWE expected Edge to sign with AEW at the conclusion of his contract.

Edge quickly responded with a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which he refuted much of what had been reported:

The 49-year-old Superstar said: ""There's nothing going on. There's no hard feelings between me and WWE. I love WWE, it's my dream gig. It's all I ever wanted to do. I didn't come at them with some crazy contract or anything, they didn't deny me. I have a contract extension sitting in my inbox, I just don't know what to do.""

Edge added that he felt the match against Sheamus would be tough to top and suggested that retiring from in-ring competition is on the table, as is signing a new deal with WWE.

Based on what Edge has said, he is still technically under contract, so his inclusion in the SmackDown video isn't necessarily out of the ordinary.

However, since those who make such graphics are likely given specific instructions on who to include and who not to include, the speculation on Edge possibly remaining in WWE is understandable.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
110,Title: Why a CM Punk Return to WWE is a No-Brainer for Both Parties,"Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

When it comes to CM Punk returning to WWE, it should be a matter of when, not if.

For anyone even slightly well-versed in the pro wrestling sphere, it is impossible not to think about Punk going back to WWE as soon as Tony Khan announced Punk had been fired from All Elite Wrestling.

Given the history there, it might have been easy to scoff at. But it's impossibly intriguing too—both parties could use each other in major ways and frankly, pro wrestling is just so much more interesting when Punk is on the mic or in the ring.

Fans weren't the only ones as soon as the news hit, either. According to Mike Johnson of PW Insider (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), top WWE stars talked about it, too. Like fans, opinions were reportedly split, but those saying ""no thanks"" wouldn't have much of a choice if the company decided to make it happen.

And why wouldn't WWE? This is a company that has patched over burned bridges with many, many Superstars since its conception. Punk would merely be the latest. Granted, those came at a time when Vince McMahon still presumably pulled most of the strings.

But from the outside looking in, who is to say the networks overlooking the proceedings don't want a Punk bump? He was, after all, given his own unique programming spot weekly with AEW. That same show's ratings immediately collapsed without him, pointing out what many fans already know—he's a huge draw.

The Punk bump would be massive, especially given the timing and feud. A Royal Rumble return would be fun, obviously. But so would an immediate re-debut to feud with someone like Seth Rollins, who not too long ago went on a possibly-out-of-character tirade about Punk being a ""cancer"" and to ""stay away."" At this point, even a fun one-off match against Roman Reigns, Kevin Owens, LA Knight, the list of possibilities goes on and on.

Oh...and don't forget a renewal of his classic feud with John Cena, if possible. Some might argue Punk was Cena's greatest foil at the height of his momentum. That as a main event of a WrestleMania on a Night 1? Sign us up.

Yes, Punk's comments about WWE since joining AEW haven't been the nicest, including his return promo. But he's brushed shoulders with WWE since walking out in 2014, first on FS1's WWE Backstage in 2019 and later backstage at a weekly Raw broadcast last April. Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful (h/t Upton) has even reported that in December of 2022, Punk wanted to leave AEW for WWE around the time of the Royal Rumble.

And while it would be a tad ironic given his character over the years, Punk returning in a non-full-time role would help to alleviate some of his problems, health and otherwise, that popped up during his full-time run back in 2014 and earlier.

WWE needs the ""legend"" slot, too. Goldberg's last hoorah wasn't exactly great, Undertaker isn't around anymore and there has been constant speculation about whether Edge will retire and/or leave soon.

If there's one thing Punk can do better than most, it's put over others, so it's not like his return role would need to be limited to fitting other veterans. He spent a big chunk of time in AEW putting over younger up-and-coming talent before pursuing titles. In WWE the effect would only be amplified, especially if they surprise everyone by giving us a heel Punk, corporate heel sellout sort of character (good if WWE wants to throw jabs at AEW and punch down via Punk's promos, too).

Punk's side of things shouldn't need much of an explainer here, of course. Working indy promotions or even overseas wouldn't be nearly as appetizing as potentially getting that ""main event"" of WrestleMania he always wanted, even if it's only on a Night 1. There are too many amazing feuds and possibilities on a part-time schedule to pass up, never mind the inevitable cash flow. Things have changed dramatically in WWE since his departure, in some ways because of him. Returning to reap those benefits would be silly to miss now.

Undoubtedly a polarizing figure, Punk is also captivating. Many lapsed fans returned to pro wrestling during his Pipebomb era. A potentially big chunk of viewership would simply tune in to see if he loses, which is a win-win for everyone, regardless. And few even current WWE stars have the crossover appeal into the mainstream that Punk has.

Punk and WWE getting back together felt impossible even a year ago. But sometimes we forget this is pro wrestling, where anything goes. The sport is better with Punk in it and it's hard to think both parties here don't see the upside worth grabbing before it's too late.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

That feud is likely to resume once Prince is cleared for action. One we may not have to wait for, though, is Judgment Day vs. the rebooted Hurt Business.

Bobby Lashley and The Street Profits hit the ring after the match and warned the tag champions that it will be him and his teammates that dominate, not Judgment Day. In terms of a high-profile feud that helps Lashley, Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins build momentum as a trio, there are far worse options to pain them with than the uber-over Judgment Day.

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Cardi B Interested in Attending WrestleMania 40

Superstar rapper Cardi B has long discussed her childhood love for WWE, and she may parlay it into an appearance at WWE's biggest event.

During an interview on Hot 97 (h/t Steve Carrier of Ringside News) this week, Cardi B spoke about her pro wrestling fandom with Peter Rosenberg, who is often part of WWE's pre-show panels before premium live events.

Cardi B downplayed the likelihood of having a match in WWE after having given birth to two children, but she expressed interest in attending WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia next year, saying: ""I mean I would love to attend, I don't know, I don't know what to do, if I need to perform or slap a bitch but like, I want to go. I have to fulfill some type of dream.""

Over the years, Cardi B has made mention of WWE on X, formerly known as Twitter, from time to time.

In 2019, she named Eddie Guerrero, Booker T, Batista, Edge, Lita, Triple H, The Undertaker and Kane as some of her favorite wrestlers, which suggests she was heavily into WWE during the Ruthless Aggression Era.

While Cardi B has yet to make a WWE appearance, her hit song ""Up"" was the official theme song for SummerSlam 2021, so she has at least some link to the company.

Rosenberg said during the interview that he would attempt to pull some strings in order to make a Cardi B appearance at WrestleMania 40 possible, meaning one of the most iconic female rappers of all time could show up on the Grandest Stage of Them All.

Cena Calls Reigns WWE's GOAT

Many wrestling fans consider John Cena to be the greatest performer in WWE history, but the 16-time world champion has a different opinion.

Per Aashrit Satija of SportsKeeda, Cena spoke to reporters Friday in India prior to WWE's Superstar Spectacle event, and it was asked for his opinion on how Roman Reigns has done as his successor as the face of WWE.

Cena went on to pay The Tribal Chief the ultimate compliment, saying: ""In my perspective, I think Roman Reigns is the greatest of all time.""

Reigns is in the midst of one of the greatest title runs in WWE history, as the undisputed WWE universal champion has now held a world championship for over three years consecutively, which is unheard of in the current era of wrestling.

During that time, Reigns has completely overhauled his character, become the most compelling figure in the wrestling business and largely earned the respect of fans who once complained about WWE pushing him to the top.

Cena was the unquestioned top star in WWE for well over a decade, and while that earned him a ton of fans, he also had his fair share of detractors, so he has a unique understanding of what Reigns has dealt with over the years.

Once Cena became WWE's top star, he never turned heel, whereas Reigns did take that leap of faith, and it has paid major dividends for him.

The company has also benefited from the decision, as it is raking in record profits and attendance numbers with Reigns at the helm.

Several Superstars belong in the WWE GOAT conversation, and the fact that one of them has put Reigns in that echelon speaks to how far he has come during his career.

Knight Reportedly in Line for Huge Push

LA Knight has quickly become one of WWE's most popular Superstars and he is reportedly in line for a big push moving forward.

According to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), Knight is expected to get a ""mega push"" due to the fact that his positive crowd reactions are being backed by strong merchandise sales and ratings for his television segments.

In recent months, live audiences have consistently popped for Knight and thrown their support behind him, resulting in the decision to make him a full-fledged babyface.

While WWE initially seemed somewhat hesitant to go all in on pushing Knight, he won a battle royal at SummerSlam and beat The Miz last weekend at Payback, which suggests the push has perhaps already begun.

On Thursday, PWInsider.com (h/t Upton) reported that WWE was either nearing or completing an agreement on a new contract for Knight, perhaps as long as five years in length.

With a new deal reportedly in place or almost in place, there is little holding WWE back from going full steam ahead with Knight's push.

While Knight remains relatively new to WWE, he is a pro wrestling veteran and is already 40 years old, so the company doesn't have much time to waste in terms of making him a top star and possibly a world champion.

The fans clearly want Knight in that spot, and it does seem as though WWE is beginning to listen to them.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
113,Title: Feud With Seth Rollins Has Brought New Life to Shinsuke Nakamura in WWE,"Photo credit: WWE.com

Shinsuke Nakamura is arguably the most charismatic and complete Japanese star to compete for WWE.

Nonetheless, his newfound rivalry with Seth Rollins has been a godsend for a superstar who went through a bit of an identity crisis for so long. Sure, we could still see glimpses of greatness, but his creative direction was inconsistent at best.

Last weekend, the former MMA fighter headlined his first premium live event after seven years in the U.S. as he challenged for the world heavyweight championship in the main event of Payback.

It has been wonderful to see him take on a villainous role again. This change suits him well, and he has an opponent, who is willing to help him explore this new character.

The King of Strong Style joined the company in 2016 after a career-defining run with New Japan Pro Wrestling. Straight away, Western fans had high hopes for the new acquisition after his highly acclaimed Wrestle Kingdom 10 match against AJ Styles.

During the Black and Gold era, the five-time IWGP Intercontinental champion immediately brought star power and a well-earned reputation to NXT. His stint with the developmental brand properly established him as a magnetic superstar among WWE's hardcore fanbase and created a new legacy to live up to.

Even if you never watched his NJPW matches, it was easy to see that there was something special about him. After all, his TakeOver debut against Sami Zayn became a must-see experience, and his captivating entrance drew the attention of the most casual viewers.

It seemed like the company had finally found its first Japanese WWE champion after he won the men's Royal Rumble match in 2018. The 43-year-old became one of the most popular winners of the last decade en route to a dream matchup with The Phenomenal One at WrestleMania 33.

However, Nakamura never quite reached that height again following an underwhelming encounter with Styles and an ill-advised heel turn. That's what makes his current feud with Rollins such a welcomed change of pace.

It's a breath of fresh air for longtime fans who felt he should've consistently remained in contention for a world title. Even more, it has given him a much-needed character arc and a turn with clear motivations.

A Fresh New Coat of Paint

On New Year's Day, Nakamura proved he still had so much to offer as he entered The Budokan in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan to face The Great Muta one last time.

At Pro Wrestling NOAH The New Year 2023, he showcased the flair and hard-hitting style that put him on the map. Afterward, the historic encounter inspired him to continue to expose the world to his style of wrestling and acquire championship gold.

Following the introduction of the new World Heavyweight Championship, Raw became the best destination for new contenders as it rebuilt its main event scene. The King of Strong Style's stiff strikes also make him an ideal heel and a believable opponent for Rollins.

Although his first heel turn in 2018 didn't live up to its potential, WWE has done a great job this time. On Aug. 21, Nakamura appeared in a vignette complete with subtitles to reveal his plan to target the champion's injured back.

It was such a fresh take on his character and a simple approach that made us wonder why it took so long to get this right. It was a great way to allow him to speak in his native tongue and continue to play mind games.

This cold and calculating persona and his deliberate offense make him much more imposing. His motivations are also more nuanced and there is more of an attention to detail.

For example, referencing the seven virtues of Bushido tattooed on Rollins' back was a clever nod to his culture. That's a far cry from the obsessive use of crotch shots that he employed in 2018.

The anime-style clip before his entrance at Payback was also a nice touch. It helped to illustrate that the language barrier isn't a limitation anymore. Instead, it's an aspect that WWE can accentuate in intriguing ways.

The Right Opponent For A Fighting Champion

Nakamura unsuccessfully challenged Rollins for the world heavyweight title on Saturday night, but this feud is far from over. In fact, the challenger attacked his foe after the match deadset on aggravating his back injury.

This was the right call because there's still more WWE can do with this feud, and it has revitalized a fan favorite. The Japanese star has managed to remain so popular even after extended time off television and poor booking decisions. So, it's great to see the company doing something different with him.

The 43-year-old isn't the performer he used to be in the ring anymore, but he can still tell an engaging story. His current character work is tremendous, and his presentation is creative and refreshing.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
114,Title: WWE's Growing Becky Lynch Problem,"3 of 5

Charlotte Flair, Ronda Rousey and Bianca Belair all brought the best out of Becky Lynch. The programs with Bayley and Trish Stratus had the potential to be special but weren't able to capture that same magic.

Tiffany Stratton could prove to be the perfect foil she desperately needs right now.

Stratton sat ringside for Lynch's matches on Raw last week and against Stratus at Payback the subsequent Saturday. Lynch then set her sights on Stratton's NXT Women's Championship, which she announced she'll challenge for on Tuesday's episode.

All signs point to it be more than a one-off for Lynch in NXT, especially with the brand's No Mercy event coming up at the end of the month. Regardless of when it is, there's a strong chance she will capture the one title that has always alluded her, if only for a brief period.

NXT did something similar with Charlotte Flair in 2020 and no one benefited from it, not even Flair herself. This run for Lynch can be beneficial if she doesn't steamroll Stratton and the two are instead allowed to have a competitive rivalry.

Stratton has had an impressive run so far but hasn't faced anyone the caliber of Lynch. Putting the belt on Lynch would freshen up The Man's stagnant character and give her a whole new batch of stars to work with for the foreseeable future.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
115,Title: Gunther Becomes WWE's Longest-Reigning Intercontinental Champion at 455 Days,"Marc Pfitzenreuter/Getty Images

Gunther officially became the longest-reigning Intercontinental champion in WWE history Thursday, surpassing the record previously held by WWE Hall of Famer The Honky Tonk Man.

WWE recognized The Ring General's accomplishment on X, formerly known as Twitter, and celebrated his 455th consecutive day as IC champ:

WWE Hall of Famer and head of creative Triple H also acknowledged Gunther cementing himself as arguably the greatest Intercontinental champion of all time:

On Monday night's episode of Raw, Gunther faced Chad Gable in the main event with the understanding that he would eclipse The Honky Tonk Man's record reign of 454 days if he managed to retain.

Gable had beaten Gunther by count-out in a previous meeting, and while he came close to dethroning Gunther on numerous occasions Monday night, the leader of Imperium put Gable down with a fury of high-impact offense to win by pinfall.

The Honky Tonk Man beat fellow Hall of Famer Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat for the IC title in June 1987 and dropped it to another Hall of Famer in The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam in August of 1988.

Warrior beat Honky Tonk in a matter of seconds, but his record for 454 days as intercontinental champion stood for a remarkable 35 years until Gunther broke it.

Gunther won the title from Ricochet on the June 10, 2022, episode of SmackDown shortly after getting called up to the main roster from NXT, and he proceeded to beat several big-name Superstars to retain it over the next 455 days.

Drew McIntyre, Sheamus, Rey Mysterio, Shinsuke Nakamura and Braun Strowman are just a few of the challengers who fell to him along the way.

Gunther has not lost a televised singles match by pinfall or submission since arriving from NXT, and there is no end in sight to his incredible run as intercontinental champion.

Given his dominance, it won't be at all surprising if Gunther adds months and even years to his newly established record.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Thunder Rosa has not competed in an All Elite Wrestling ring since the August 8 episode of Dark Elevation, where she partnered with Hikaru Shida and Toni Storm to defeat Emi Sakura, Marina Shafir and Nyla Rose in a trios match.



However, her lengthy absence from the squared circle due to a back injury may be nearing its end.



Sapp reported: ""Fightful Select has been told that Thunder Rosa could return to the ring at almost 'any time,' provided creative is produced for her. Rosa had spoken to some at this past weekend's Starrcast, and sources within AEW indicated that she is ready to return. Whether or not she does imminently remains to be seen.""

The most interesting tidbit in the report is, ""provided creative is produced for her.""



Considering the current lack of creative throughout the women's division in AEW, it may be a long wait for her fans.

In all seriousness, though, Rosa is a talented wrestler who was one-half of the two most memorable matches in AEW's women's division history: The Lights Out and steel cage matches against Britt Baker.



She won the AEW World Women's Championship from Baker in the latter but was never able to finish out her reign, thanks to the back injury that has plagued her and kept her from the squared circle.



The announcement of Collision was accompanied by media prominently featuring Rosa, suggesting she would be back as a member of the Saturday night roster. She has yet to compete in a match, instead serving on the AEW Spanish announce team.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
117,Title: WWE Rumors: Latest on LA Knight's Long-Term Contract Negotiations with WWE amid Push,"Photo credit: WWE.com

WWE and rising star LA Knight have reportedly engaged in long-term contract negotiations during his recent emergence as one of the company's most popular performers.

According to PWInsider.com (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), WWE and Knight have either completed a deal or are close to doing so, and the new contract reportedly may be up to five years in length.

After enjoying a great deal of success in Impact Wrestling and NWA under the name Eli Drake, Knight signed with WWE in 2021 and began on the NXT brand.

Knight quickly got over with the NXT crowd, leading to his main roster call-up last year, although it came in a completely unexpected role.

He was renamed Max Dupri and was in a managerial role as the head of Maximum Male Models. Perhaps not coincidentally, the character was dropped once Triple H replaced Vince McMahon as head of WWE creative, and the LA Knight gimmick returned shortly thereafter.

Ever since the build toward WrestleMania 39 earlier this year, Knight has consistently gotten huge reactions from the WWE Universe, essentially forcing him to transition from a heel to a babyface.

Knight finally broke through with his biggest main roster win to that point at SummerSlam in August when he won a battle royal.

More recently, Knight defeated The Miz last weekend at Payback in a match that saw John Cena serve as the special guest referee.

Knight and Cena had a disagreement during the match, and Knight initially refused to shake Cena's hand, but they ultimately showed respect for another.

Since Cena is scheduled to stick around in WWE for the next two months, it is possible the angle was done to either set up a match between Knight and Cena or a tag match in which they team together.

Whatever the case, it is clearly a great sign for Knight and his push that WWE sees enough in him to involve him heavily with one of the biggest WWE stars of all time in Cena.

It has taken the 40-year-old Knight many years in the wrestling business to reach this level, but he is finally being recognized as one of the top guys in WWE and pro wrestling as a whole.

If Knight and WWE are indeed in agreement or nearing an agreement on a new contract, it could be a sign that the promotion intends to push him even more with a world title run potentially in his future.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Forcing The American Nightmare to wrestle this match from the start and go through all Reigns' previous rivals before last eliminating Zayn would be a powerful story to tell of deciding who would finally end his reign of terror.



From there, what matters most is that Rhodes and Reigns interact. The Tribal Chief has a mental edge he can exploit. He has previously defeated The American Nightmare, who has still to prove he can win in the main event of the biggest shows.



With at least Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa still by his side, Reigns would find every way to get a physical and mental edge over Rhodes before the big night.

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Top Stars Don't Want CM Punk in WWE

In the wake of his firing from All Elite Wrestling, CM Punk's future in the sport has been a hot topic of discussion.

While there has been talk of him possibly going back to WWE, it doesn't sound like too many people in the company are high on the idea.

Per Mike Johnson of PW Insider (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), some of the top stars in WWE were ""adamantly against the idea"" of Punk coming in and ""didn't believe it could happen"" anyway.

Johnson did note there were some who viewed the opportunity to bring in Punk as a ""chance to make big money,"" including one top-tier superstar who was all for the idea but knows it's not their call.

On the latest episode of The Hall of Fame podcast (starts at :50 mark), Booker T gave a resounding ""no"" when asked if he thought Punk would return to WWE:

""No, I don't think so at all. I don't see that happening. Go back and look at some of CM Punk's quotes about WWE over the last seven-eight years. Nothing, man, nothing nothing positive. And my think was I always said, you never know when you might want to cross that bridge again. You just never know. And to think that that might be the company you're gonna stay at forever, that's kinda like wishful thinking.""

Punk hasn't wrestled for WWE since walking out of the company after the 2014 Royal Rumble. When he debuted for AEW in August 2021, his first promo saw him address at least some of the reasons why he left wrestling seven years earlier.

""I understand, if you all try to understand that I was never gonna get healthy physically, mentally, spiritually, or emotionally, staying in the same place that got me sick in the first place,"" he said.

The former WWE champion has had some contact with the company in recent years. He appeared on FS1's WWE Backstage show in 2019 and was backstage before an episode of Raw in Chicago on April 24.

AEW president Tony Khan announced Punk's contract had been terminated with cause following an investigation into an incident with Jack Perry that occurred backstage at All In on Aug. 27.

This was the second high-profile incident Punk was involved in over the past 12 months. He was in a physical altercation with Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks in the locker room at All Out 2022 after talking about issues he had with some of AEW's executive vice presidents, a group that includes Omega and the Bucks.

Punk was off television for nine months following the backstage brawl. He was also recovering from a torn triceps that was suffered in his match with Jon Moxley in the main event of the pay-per-view.

Upon returning this summer, Punk had been positioned as the top star on Collision when the show debuted on June 17. His final match in AEW was a victory over Samoa Joe at All In to retain the ""real world championship.""

Latest on Liv Morgan's Injury

Liv Morgan could be getting closer to making her in-ring return after being sidelined since June due to a shoulder injury.

Per Johnson (h/t Upton), she is expected to meet with doctors next week for a follow-up exam in Birmingham, Alabama.

While this doesn't provide a specific timeline for her comeback, it's a sign that things are at least progressing for the 29-year-old.

Morgan hasn't been seen since being attacked by Rhea Ripley before a scheduled match between the two on the July 24 episode of Raw.

The Australian used a steel chair to attack her opponent's left arm in a way to write her off television.

Morgan previously said on the UpUpDownDown YouTube show (h/t Nick Tylwalk of Wrestling Junkie) on June 3 she had a ""torn shoulder."" She didn't wrestle for six weeks from May 12 through June 24.

As a result of the injury, she and Raquel Rodriguez vacated the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship. They defeated Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler to regain the titles at Money in the Bank when The Queen of Spades turned on her partner.

On the July 17 episode of Raw, Morgan and Rodriguez lost the titles to Chelsea Green and Sonya Deville. Morgan's left arm was noticeably in a brace and wrapped during the match.

When Morgan does make her return, it will be a huge boost to the women's division on Raw. She can be a top star on her own as a potential challenger to Ripley or as part of a duo to help add depth to a what is currently a very weak women's tag team division.

WWE Officials High on Zoey Stark

Even though her alliance with Trish Stratus is over, Zoey Stark's future in WWE appears to be very bright.

Per Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful (h/t Upton), WWE officials have been keeping a close eye on Stark from the time she originally signed with the company in 2021:

""We're told that WWE had their eye on her pretty early on, and she gained praise for her resilience in returning from her knee injury, and not missing a beat in the ring. WWE soon after made sure to get multiple looks at her on Main Event, where she got good reviews internally, and helped lead to her Royal Rumble appearance. We're told that not long after the Royal Rumble appearance, she was slated for a call-up to the WWE main roster. By March, NXT was told to wrap up her run there.""

Stark was only in NXT for two years before getting added to the main roster in April as part of the 2023 draft when she was selected by Raw. Her first major angle was attacking Becky Lynch during a match with Stratus at Night of Champions.

WWE put Stark in three singles matches against Lynch on Raw over the summer. She even got a victory over The Man on the July 10 episode with some assistance from Stratus.

After Stratus and Lynch settled their feud at Payback when Lynch won a steel cage match, the WWE Hall of Famer berated her protégé before Stark hit her with the Z-360.

It's unclear what's next for Stark, though it may be a tag team with Baszler based on the aftermath of their match on Monday's episode of Raw.

The fact that Stark was a key part of the highest-profile women's feud on the red brand for the past four months speaks well about her upside going forward.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Tiffany Stratton and Kiana James went at each other from the outset, throwing out their biggest shots immediately.

However, The Center of the Universe took the win with the Prettiest Moonsault Ever.



Becky Lynch appeared on the titantron afterward to lay out a challenge to Stratton for the NXT Women's Championship next week. The contest was then confirmed as the main event.



This was a bizarre match. Stratton and James flew through their choreography in the very definition of a sprint. The action was solid, but they never got a chance to breathe. It was like NXT was trying to get this out of the way.



Perhaps that was the exact plan because Lynch is already next up for The Center of the Universe. It seemed odd to dismiss a match that was built over three weeks to set up a a last-minute title bout next week.



The Man is a major challenge for Stratton as there is no bigger star in the women's division. Somehow, The Center of the Universe will keep her title next week, but Lynch will require her to wrestle the most complete match of her career.



Result

Stratton def. James by pinfall to retain the NXT Women's Championship.

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Jey Uso Set for Singles Push

After main-eventing SummerSlam and now being traded to Raw, Jey Uso is poised for a singles run on the red brand.

Per Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), WWE officials are optimistic about Uso's potential to be a solo star going forward.

Jey made a surprise return at Payback on Saturday when Cody Rhodes revealed he used his influence to get the former Bloodline member traded to Raw.

It was the first time Uso has been on television since he quit WWE on the Aug. 11 episode of SmackDown in the wake of Jimmy Uso turning on him at SummerSlam.

Jey is in the midst of the biggest push of his career. He pinned Roman Reigns in the Bloodline Civil War at Money in the Bank, leading to him challenging the Tribal Chief for the undisputed WWE universal title at SummerSlam.

Moving him off of SmackDown allows Uso to work on his own without having to confront the Bloodline, at least for the time being. It also provides him with a chance to showcase what he can do as a solo act after spending his entire career in a tag team with Jimmy.

Kevin Owens Pulled from Raw

On the heels of losing the undisputed tag team titles at Payback, Kevin Owens was noticeably absent from Raw.

Per Mike Johnson of PW Insider, Owens was backstage at the arena on Monday night and at one point slated to wrestle JD McDonagh before being removed from the show.

Sami Zayn did address his partner's absence during the opening promo segment when he told Jey Uso there are a lot of superstars in the locker room holding a grudge against him for what he did during his time in the Bloodline.

""Even Kevin Owens and I haven't always seen eye to eye when it comes to this whole situation,"" Zayn said. ""But it's fine. Kevin Owens isn't even here tonight.""

McDonagh, who interfered on behalf of the Judgment Day at Payback to help Damian Priest and Finn Balor win the tag titles, wrestled Zayn on Monday night. McDonagh got the win with an assist from Dominik Mysterio.

It's unclear why Owens wasn't on the show.

There was a spot in Saturday's tag title match when Owens hit Mysterio with a senton off the balcony in the stands that looked like he overshot the target and landed hard on the ground.

Owens had a legit rib injury that kept him out of action for several weeks before he worked a series of dark matches and house show events recently leading up to Payback.

Latest on Carlito's WWE Return

Nearly three months after reportedly signing a contract with WWE, Carlito has yet to do anything on television with the company.

Per Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Radio (h/t Upton), Carlito is under contract but WWE has no plan in place to use him.

After Carlito's surprise appearance at Backlash in Puerto Rico, Meltzer reported in June (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News) the former intercontinental champion told a promoter from an independent show he was scheduled to work he had to cancel because he signed a deal with WWE.

There's been no indication at this point there is anything in the works for Carlito. His most recent matches were against Matt Cardona for the House of Glory heavyweight title on June 16 and a tag match with Chase Oliver against Jack Verville and Louis Lyndon on June 17.

Carlito worked for WWE from 2003 to '10 before being released. He won the intercontinental title, United States title and tag team titles with Primo.

That unhappiness will ultimately lead to the in-ring return of the 16-time world champion.



Cena and The Miz have competed against each other several times over the course of their careers and have an almost effortless chemistry. They can work a match that is safe and not nearly as physically taxing on the veteran, making it the perfect bout for the all-timer's first match back since WrestleMania 39.



Add to that the fact that The A-Lister can absorb losses without them adversely affecting him, thanks to his ability to garner heat from the crowd and remain relevant as a result, and it's difficult to find fault with that particular direction.

As they were leaving the ringside area, they passed Drew McIntyre and Riddle on the way to the ring. Both men stopped and made their feelings about Jey known before heading to the ring to face Erik and Ivar.

The first match didn't start until about 25 minutes into the show. The Raiders took on Riddle and McIntyre in a Tornado Tag match, which means all four men were legal at the same time.

Even though it took some time for the action to start, this bout had good energy and some fun spots. The crowd's request for tables was even granted. There were moments when the pacing was a bit off, but most of what we got here was entertaining enough to keep the crowd reacting.

Gunther defeated Chad Gable on Monday night's episode of WWE Raw to retain the Intercontinental Championship and ensure that he will surpass The Honky Tonk Man for the longest IC title reign in WWE history.

Gable put up a fight, but in the end, the Ring General managed to hold on to his belt and continue his march toward the record.

The Honky Tonk Man—a WWE Hall of Famer—was recognized as being intercontinental champion for 454 days from 1987 to 1988, and entering Monday night, his record reign had lasted for a remarkable 35 years.

Gunther went into Raw just a few days shy of that 454-day mark, but it was made clear that Monday would represent his final title defense and hurdle before breaking the record.

Since winning the IC title from Ricochet on the June 10, 2022, episode of SmackDown, The Ring General has been a dominant force, beating all contenders placed in front of him.

Gable is far smaller than Gunther and hasn't often gotten extended chances to prove himself as a singles star during his WWE career, but there was something about him that gave the leader of Imperium issues.

On the July 31 edition of Raw, Gunther doubted Gable's ability to last five minutes in the ring with him. The Alpha Academy founder surpassed the five-minute mark and was initially ruled the winner, but Gunther insisted that the match continue.

Gunther did go on to win, but it was one of the first times during his reign that he looked vulnerable and like he had possibly met his match.

Gable beat Matt Riddle, Tommaso Ciampa and Ricochet in a Fatal 4-Way match to earn a subsequent Intercontinental Championship match, which occurred on the Aug. 21 Raw.

On that night, Gable became the first Superstar to beat Gunther in a singles match on the main roster, but since it was by count-out, The Ring General retained.

Gunther was incensed by the loss and vowed to get revenge in the rematch, while Gable reveled in the thought that he had gotten inside Gunther's head.

Despite that apparent mental edge, Gable could not upend Gunther on Raw, meaning the Austrian star will now go down as the greatest intercontinental champion in WWE history.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
126,Title: WWE Rumors: CM Punk Was Open to 2023 Royal Rumble Return; Kevin Owens Linked,"Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

CM Punk's firing from AEW came after a tumultuous run that saw him miss significant time from the wrestling ring due to various injuries and incidents.

However, Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful reported on Monday that Punk was ready to jump ship a while ago, and he even considered making a surprise return to WWE.

""Those close to Punk claim that around December 2022, Punk was open to leaving AEW, and even encouraged the idea so he could make a WWE return. Specifically, we've heard that he wanted to appear at the 2023 Royal Rumble,"" Sapp stated (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News). ""However, we've not heard and traction to WWE having interest in such a thing, or that AEW were actually entertaining the idea of giving Punk his release at that point.""

During the timeframe that Sapp referenced, Punk was recovering from surgery to repair his torn left triceps, which he suffered in Sept. 2022 during AEW's All Out pay-per-view event. He was also serving a suspension from AEW for his involvement in a backstage brawl at that event with AEW executive vice presidents Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks.

Punk's original run with WWE came to an end in 2014 following a string of injuries and a contentious relationship with the company's higher-ups. He said he received his termination papers on his wedding day in June of that year.

While Punk's return to WWE didn't gain much traction, Sapp noted that things got as far as identifying a potential first opponent to work a rivalry against during the leadup to WrestleMania 39.

""One of the rumored ideas that Punk had—not confirmed with he or his camp—actually made its way back to some WWE talent,"" Sapp stated. ""The idea was that Punk would return at the 2023 WWE Royal Rumble, and work a match at WWE WrestleMania against the person who would eventually eliminate him. Word within WWE was that Kevin Owens was the name thrown around. He'd go on to main event night one of WrestleMania.""

That obviously never came to fruition. Punk made his return to AEW in June on the premiere episode of AEW Collision.

Following a reported altercation with Jack Perry at the All In pay-per-view event in London on Aug. 27, AEW CEO Tony Khan announced on Saturday that the company had terminated its employment and wrestling agreements with the 44-year-old. Khan went on to note that the incident involving Punk at All In was the first time he ""feared for his safety at a show.""

It remains to be seen what the next step is for the former world champion, as Punk is at a career crossroads following yet another unceremonious firing from a top wrestling promotion.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from WWE and All Elite Wrestling.

Tony Khan Addresses CM Punk Departure after All Out

AEW announced Saturday it terminated CM Punk's contract following a backstage incident during All In on Aug. 27. Tony Khan, the promotion's CEO, addressed the situation on the most recent edition of Collision and was asked again about Punk following All Out on Sunday.

In particular, Khan was pressed about whether the former world champion has any sort of non-compete clause tied to his departure.

""I don't want to discuss the terms of the separation, in that sense,"" he told reporters. ""I think it's best to say—first of all, I very much want to thank CM Punk, Phil, for everything he did for AEW as a wrestler.

""But, I don't think it was an easy decision for anybody on the discipline committee or for the outside counsel or for me to do something like that. But I do think it was the right move, and as far as what's going to happen in the future, I can't speak to that. I'm not the attorneys who interpret all that language.""

The comments will do little to cool the speculation of CM Punk's possible return to WWE—no matter how unlikely—now that the door is firmly closed on AEW.

Christian Cage Sidesteps Question about Edge in AEW; Reveals New Contract

Edge is another wrestling legend bound for free agency with his WWE contract due to expire. AEW would be a natural landing spot if the Rated-R Superstar wants to continue his career elsewhere.

Don't ask his former tag team partner about this possibility, though. Christian Cage had a succinct response after All Out when discussing the likelihood of Edge joining him in the company.

The 49-year-old did at least confirm he signed a ""big fat contract"" to extend his stay in AEW.

Edge and Christian have both been excellent individually in their current roles, and a reunion has the potential to deliver some magic should it come to fruition.

Jack Perry Serving an Indefinite Suspension

Punk isn't the only party who suffered consequences in connection to the All In incident. Khan confirmed Jack Perry received an indefinite suspension and has been absent backstage since the show in London.

There were reports that both Punk and Perry were suspended in the immediate aftermath of their physical altercation.

Based on Khan's comments, it's unclear when Perry will be back in an AEW ring, and that uncertainty is less than ideal for the 26-year-old when he has found his footing as a singles heel. Even in a losing effort to Hook at All In, he continued to impress.

In a way, though, all of this drama might work to Perry's benefit because he's bound to generate a massive reaction the first time he shows back up on AEW programming.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Becky Lynch and Tiffany Stratton Come Face-to-Face

Becky Lynch has never held the NXT Women's Championship, a fact current champion Tiffany Stratton was eager to point out Saturday at Payback. The backstage confrontation, moments after The Man's extraordinary victory over Trish Stratus inside a steel cage ignited a feud the competitors deserve.

For Lynch, the rivalry represents an opportunity to achieve something she was never really considered for during her time with NXT. She struggled to find herself with the black and gold brand during her time in Florida and, while she undeniably helped revolutionize the industry through her work with the Four Horsewomen, she was never the focal point that her peers were.

Feuding with Stratton allows her to return to the brand on which she made a name for herself and win the title that has, to this point, eluded her.

Conversely, the feud provides Stratton the opportunity to work with a star who has main evented WrestleMania and is one of the faces of the company. She earned it, evolving from an inexperienced yet athletic ""daddy's girl"" to one of the brightest young stars in the game and someone brimming with confidence.

The feud allows Lynch to share some of her star power with NXT and prep the future of the industry while allowing Stratton the chance to appear on Monday nights and form an early relationship with the WWE Universe.

With no other obvious direction for Lynch right now, bringing this feud to life and reaping the rewards is the right call and one of the most obviously great creative decisions of the entire Payback broadcast.

The Judgment Day's Dominance

Finn Balor, Damian Priest, Dominik Mysterio, and Rhea Ripley have been central figures in WWE Raw's creative efforts for the last year. Whether they were headlining broadcasts against top babyfaces like Seth Rollins, Cody Rhodes, Kevin Owens, and Sami Zayn, or Ripley and Mysterio were infuriating fans as one of the most over acts in the company, they have been integral to the flagship show.

Though Ripley and Mysterio entered Saturday's show as champions, and Priest arrived as Mr. Money in the Bank, it was The Archer of Infamy and Balor's victory over Zayn and Owens for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship that served as the official coronation of the faction as the premier group in the company.

The image of all four draped in gold, pyro exploding behind them, the elation of victory painting their faces, was that of a faction that had finally realized its potential. After a rocky start and the ill-fitting leadership of Edge, the group reset and was afforded the time to discover its chemistry.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

130,Title: WWE Rumors: 'A Lot of Top' Stars Don't Want CM Punk to Return after AEW Firing,"Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

CM Punk's future in wrestling is a hot topic of debate in the wake of his firing from AEW.

Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful Select noted there's ""always a chance"" Punk could return to WWE, but ""a lot of top"" stars on the roster don't want him to be brought in.

AEW CEO Tony Khan announced Saturday that Punk was fired with cause following an investigation into an altercation that took place during the All In pay-per-view on Aug. 27.

Perry wasn't on Saturday's episode of Collision, nor is he booked for a match on Sunday's All Out pay-per-view.

According to Sapp, it's unclear if CM Punk has any sort of non-compete clause or severance period included in his contract since he was fired with cause.

If there is a non-compete or severance period in the deal, Punk wouldn't be allowed to work for another wrestling company until it came to an end.

Sapp also noted Punk still has ""major heat with numerous top names in WWE, and was asked to leave earlier this year when he showed up"" backstage at the April 24 episode of Raw that was held in Chicago.

CM Punk returned to AEW for the premiere episode of Collision on June 17. He had been absent for nine months following a backstage altercation with The Elite (Kenny Omega, The Young Bucks) after the All Out pay-per-view in September 2022.

Punk also suffered a torn triceps during his match against Jon Moxley on the show that required surgery.

131,Title: WWE Payback Puts Deserved Spotlight on The Judgment Day as Bloodline Takes a Backseat,"The 2023 edition of Payback from PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh on Saturday night was all about one WWE faction—just not the one most might expect.

The Judgment Day, not Roman Reigns and The Bloodline, dominated the show.

Exiting the event, one could argue it was the perfect play, swapping out a storyline and faction slightly wearing out its welcome with something more refreshing.

Refreshing, in the sense that WWE wasn't afraid to give the green light on the combination of Damian Priest and Finn Bálor stunningly taking down Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens to steal the undisputed WWE tag team titles.

More predictable—but still as fun as it gets—was Rhea Ripley, with Dominik Mysterio right there, of course, shoving aside Raquel Rodriguez to retain the women's world title.

Outside of a quick reveal that Jey Uso is back and now a member of the Raw roster (after Jimmy's confrontation with John Cena on the go-home SmackDown), The Bloodline was absent. No Reigns. No major story beats. Nothing.

And everyone in the main event orbit is better for it.

Truth be told, while Reigns and the saga of The Bloodline is one of the best pro wrestling stories ever, it needed some time to breathe. Fans know it won't see a resolution until the next WrestleMania anyway and, while the latest happenings were still amazing (Jimmy betraying Jey to prevent him from becoming like Reigns), it was understandable if fans felt some fatigue. No point in risking the complete souring of the story by watering it down.

To say The Judgment Day is better for it is slightly underselling things too. Now Bálor and Priest will have to work together as tag champions despite the awkward detail that is the latter holding the Money in the Bank briefcase and butting heads with the former about it at times. That tension is hardly over.

And Ripley, as we've written recently, is well on her way to becoming the Reigns of the women's division and in a good way. Her matches are few and far between, but she's must-see every time, plays critical roles in top stories and has started to transcend pro wrestling itself with major crossover appeal to the mainstream.

Her match against Rodriguez was, in a word, fantastic. For now, there continues to be a tense suspicion that perhaps sooner than later, she ascends from the stable, too, perhaps forming her own while taking Mysterio with her.

If there was a big complaint, it was the non-swerve that was Priest not cashing-in on Seth Rollins after the heavyweight champion survived a 26-minute slugfest with Shinsuke Nakamura. It felt like the story was making an overly big deal about The Visionary's hurt back to set up the lose-title-but-not-credibility angle when The Archer of Infamy sniped it as the show went to black.

Instead, fans merely got a comment from Bálor and Priest about going to celebrate the successes of their stable as justification, which will have some fans thinking the latter might just be a goofball.

But hey, there are worse complaints to have coming out of Payback. What is usually a rather mid-level event blatantly sandwiched as a space-filler between SummerSlam and WrestleMania season, The Judgement Day in the spotlight made it one of the better PLEs of the year.

Yes, most of this is working overtime to set up some sort of team-based Survivor Series angle too, but as long-term booking, it sure beats the days when WWE would randomly throw colored t-shirts at Superstars and tell them to get out there on short notice with no story.

For many fans, there was concern about how WWE would stretch The Bloodline to the next 'Mania. As it turns out, injecting The Judgment Day into the spotlight via a refreshing reembracing of factions is the perfect move.

While developments, especially around Mysterio and Ripley, continue to roll out by the week, the Uso brothers can do their separate thing, Reigns can make the sporadic appearance, and the likes of Paul Heyman can help position Solo Sikoa for a bigger role over the long term.

Flanked by other obvious high marks such as Rollins' title reign, LA Knight, Cody Rhodes and a deep women's division, WWE has an embarrassment of riches for fans to enjoy right now.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Becky Lynch turned lemons into lemonade Saturday night, delivering another extraordinary performance in a career full of them by kicking off Payback with a Match of the Year candidate against Trish Stratus.

It was a hard-hitting bout that left both women with physical reminders and included two jaw-dropping spots: A superplex from the top of the cage and an avalanche Manhandle Slam, with the latter earning The Man the victory.

This was what fans should have gotten at SummerSlam, but in hindsight, it may be better that it took place at Payback. While it's not the stage that the summertime spectacular is, it provided the women more time and a brighter spotlight than they would have received in August.

Sure, the feud dragged on a bit too long and the storyline accompanying it never really matched the magnitude of two of the most influential women in wrestling history competing against each other, but the culmination made up for it all.

This was a legitimate MOTY candidate and something both women should be immensely proud of.

The post-match events, which saw the WWE Hall of Famer berate Zoey Stark before being left lying in the center of the ring, should nicely segue the heel mentor out of her program with Lynch and into a feud with her protégé.

The feud between Becky Lynch and Trish Stratus fell off quickly over the past month. It should have ended at SummerSlam. When the two missed that spot, they both clearly took offense.



This led to an opener that stole the show on Saturday. Stratus turned back the clock, working at a speed and with flexibility that should not be possible at 47 years old. It may be the best match of her career.



Lynch worked her best match of 2023. It was physical and intense, and she carried that heat on her face and in her walk.



At a time when the women's division has struggled, Stratus and Lynch had one of the best matches of the year.

Pro wrestling is always looking for the next big thing; the star that will carry the industry into the next two decades and stand atop the proverbial mountain as the one true face of the sport.

""The star of the future"" label is often bandied about, with some discussions proving prophetic and others reflecting a flash-in-the-pan that never quite materialized into the attraction those in the industry hoped they would become.

LA Knight is not the next big thing, nor is he a star of the future. No, the veteran competitor is, instead, a star of the here and now.

The Megastar rolled into Pittsburgh on Saturday and was the most popular guy on a show that also featured Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, and John Cena. His pop was the loudest, the volume of the chants of his name never decreased, and the energy in the arena when he hit the ring was palpable.

Knight carries himself like a star, the crowd believes he is, and he has found catchphrases and elements of his in-ring work that allow the audience to participate. All three of those are key in today's professional wrestling landscape and Knight either has or is in the process of mastering them.

It has allowed him to overcome the horrendous Maxx Dupri nonsense and be himself, to incredible success. So much so that Cena, the special referee for his victory over The Miz, extended his hand as both a sign of respect and acknowledgment of all that Knight has done to scratch and claw his way to the top.

He has very much arrived; the star of today and now that it recognizes as much, it is time for the company to book him as such, in top stories with fellow headliners. It does not have to be for the world title for Knight to truly be considered a top-tier competitor, but he does have to share the stage with the best and most recognizable names.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

LA Knight beat The Miz in a heated grudge match at WWE Payback on Saturday night with John Cena as special guest referee.

Cena and The A-Lister had a battle on the mic earlier in the evening.

The veteran soon revealed that he was a special guest referee for the LA Knight-The Miz match:

The bad blood between the two continued into the match, with Cena reprimanding The Miz for trying to use the rope for leverage during his pin attempt:

Eventually, Knight beat The Miz with the BFT. Afterward, Cena showed a sign of respect to the victor:



The two charismatic Superstars first crossed paths in a Battle Royal at SummerSlam. Knight eliminated Miz from the match and went on to win it, giving him the biggest victory of his main roster career.

Clearly miffed by The Megastar getting the better of him, The A-Lister talked trash about him on a recent episode of Raw, prompting Knight to introduce himself, only for Miz to refuse a handshake.

In the weeks that followed, Knight and Miz traded verbal barbs regularly, and they also mixed it up in a few physical confrontations.

The Megastar embarrassed Miz on several occasions, including during an episode of Raw when The A-Lister claimed he would be facing an opponent who was far superior to Knight. That opponent ended up being Akira Tozawa.

With Knight at ringside for the match, Miz was clearly distracted, and The A-Lister ended up suffering a humiliating defeat.

Last week on SmackDown, Knight honored the life of Bray Wyatt before turning his attention to Miz and vowing to make him pay for his constant snide remarks and attempts to discredit what The Megastar has done.

Never one to let another person get the last word, The Miz hit back on this week's Raw by further diminishing Knight's success and connection with the fans.

The two-time WWE champion dressed up like Knight and impersonated him in a segment that was reminiscent of when he pretended to be Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson over a decade ago.

Miz claimed Knight is a wannabe Attitude Era wrestler who tries to be like The Rock and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin rather than being original. He also chastised the fans for buying into his shtick.

Seth Rollins beat Shinsuke Nakamura at WWE Payback on Saturday to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.

The Visionary hit his opponent with a Curb Stomp to retain his title.

Rollins has been a marked man in WWE ever since becoming the inaugural world heavyweight champion in May, and Nakamura is the latest Superstar to step up to him.

A few weeks ago on Raw, Rollins was supposed to team with Cody Rhodes and Sami Zayn against The Judgment Day, but Zayn was taken out due to a backstage attack at the hands of JD McDonagh.

Rollins and Rhodes had to find a replacement partner as a result, and Nakamura offered to step in and fight alongside them.

Nakamura, Rollins and Rhodes meshed well in that victory, but the celebration was short-lived, as The King of Strong Style shockingly turned heel and hit Rollins with the Kinshasa.

In the weeks that followed, a more ruthless and aggressive side of Nakamura emerged, and he also committed to playing mind games with his rival.

During a confrontation on Raw, Nakamura whispered something in Rollins' ear, and it was clear that he was disturbed by what the Japanese Superstar told him.

On the next episode of Raw, Nakamura revealed he told Rollins he knows about his back injury and intended to exploit it during their clash at Payback.

Rollins conceded he has been dealing with fractures in his lower back for four years before adding that he is unsure how much longer he will be able to perform at the highest level of professional wrestling.

Nakamura seemingly had the champion's focus shaken leading up to Payback, perhaps giving him his best opportunity yet to win a world title in WWE.

Rhea Ripley defeated Raquel Rodriguez to retain the Women's World Championship at WWE Payback on Saturday.

The Australian hit Rodriguez with a Riptide for the win after her opponent had struck an interfering Dominik Mysterio with a powerslam.

Ripley was ready in waiting, though, and later used her finisher to retain her title.

For nearly two months, Ripley and Rodriguez have been embroiled in a bitter rivalry, stemming from the Judgment Day member essentially costing Rodriguez and Liv Morgan the WWE Women's Tag Team Championships.

Prior to a title defense against Chelsea Green and Sonya Deville in July, Rodriguez and Morgan were attacked by Ripley. Raquel suffered a knee injury, and it led directly to Green and Deville winning the belts.

With Ripley on the shelf due to a knee ailment, Ripley focused her attention on Morgan and sent her to the injured list as well by trapping her arm inside a steel chair and stomping on it.

Despite not being cleared for in-ring competition, a furious Rodriguez tried to get revenge on Ripley in the weeks that followed, leading to multiple brawls between them.

A couple of weeks ago on Raw, Rodriguez emerged following a match between Ripley and Candice LeRae. She limped out on a crutch, but it was a ruse, as she tossed it away and took the fight to the Aussie.

Rodriguez revealed that she was officially cleared to wrestle again, and a title match between the two was booked for Payback.

While Ripley and Rodriguez are close friends in real life, they have had their fair share of intense in-ring battles against each other, dating back to their time together in NXT.

Both were NXT women's champions, but individual success from NXT to the main roster translated more quickly for Ripley, who has been the dominant force in the women's division.

Rodriguez is a multi-time tag team champion, but Payback represented one of her first major opportunities to win singles gold on the main roster.

It was the ultimate endorsement of Knight by the 16-time world champion, but there should be more to come between them.

While a one-on-one affair seems to be the most obvious direction to go in, having them team up would work just as well. Knight is already being fast-tracked to the top of the card, and having Cena be a small part of his ascent could do wonders for his career.

The Master of the 619 beat the former titleholder after pinning him following a victory roll.

Saturday's bout was a rematch to an encounter that took place on the Aug. 11 episode of SmackDown and saw Mysterio beat Theory to become U.S. champ for the third time in his career.

With that victory, Mysterio ended A-Town's reign at 257 days, which was the third-longest United States Championship reign under the WWE umbrella behind only those of Dean Ambrose and MVP.

Several weeks ago, a modified tournament was set up to determine who would be the next challenger for Theory.

Mysterio won a Fatal 4-Way match against LA Knight, Sheamus and Cameron Grimes, while Santos Escobar beat AJ Styles, Grayson Waller and Butch, setting up a singles match between the LWO stablemates.

Escobar won the match to become No. 1 contender because it had to be cut short when Mysterio suffered an injury.

That set the stage for Escobar vs. Theory for the United States Championship on the Aug. 11 edition of SmackDown, but A-Town attacked his opponent before the match, and he was not medically cleared to compete.

Mysterio stepped up to take Escobar's place, and he made the most of the opportunity by beating Theory for the title.

Theory subsequently faced Knight in a match to determine who Mysterio's first title defense would be against, and the former champ prevailed thanks to interference from The Miz.

In what was perhaps the finale of their long-running rivalry, Becky Lynch beat WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus in a steel cage match at Payback on Saturday.

Lynch hit Stratus with the Manhandle Slam off the top rope to get the pin. She previously hit the veteran with a superplex off the top of the cage:

Zoey Stark had attempted to interfere on behalf of her mentor but failed to prevent Lynch winning, and she ended her alliance with Stratus following a disagreement between the two after the match:

Lynch and Stratus have been at odds since shortly after WrestleMania 39, and it has been a long time coming for them to clash in a one-on-one match without any distractions.

During the build toward 'Mania, Stratus made her WWE return by helping Lynch and Lita beat Damage CTRL for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championships, and she teamed with The Man and Lita in a winning effort against the group at The Show of Shows.

Just a couple of weeks later, Lita was attacked backstage prior to a scheduled title defense against Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez, prompting Stratus to step in as her replacement.

Lynch and Stratus dropped the tag team titles, and the veteran then shocked the WWE Universe by attacking The Man.

That led to a match between Lynch and the newly villainous Stratus at Night of Champions in May when an unexpected figure got involved and cost The Man the match.

Just weeks after getting called up to the main roster for NXT, Stark emerged from under the ring to take out Lynch behind the referee's back, allowing Stratus to pin her.

Over the next several weeks, the Irish Superstar scratched and clawed to get another crack at Stratus, and she finally did so by beating Stark in a singles bout.

That set the stage for an encounter between Lynch and Stratus on the Aug. 14 episode of Raw, but they fought to a double count-out, necessitating a stipulation that would determine a clear-cut winner in the rematch.

According to Fightful's Sean Ross Sapp and multiple other reports, Punk and ""Jungle Boy"" Jack Perry were involved in a backstage altercation prior to the start of the main card at All In, which was held at Wembley Stadium in London in front of over 80,000 fans.

During a match against Hook on the Zero Hour pre-show, Perry pointed to the windshield of a car on the stage and remarked, ""Real glass, cry me a river.""

It was previously reported by Sapp (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News) that Punk and Perry had a backstage run-in before a recent episode of Collision over Perry wanting to use real glass in a segment.

Despite the backstage issue at All In, Punk opened the pay-per-view against longtime on-screen rival Samoa Joe, beating him to retain the ""real"" AEW World Championship.

Punk suffered a triceps injury during his win over Jon Moxley at AEW All Out in September 2022, which was a match Punk won to become a two-time AEW champion.

The injury kept Punk out for several months, and once he returned, he reintroduced the belt he never lost and called it the ""real"" AEW World Championship.

While AEW did not recognize it as an official title, Punk defended it multiple times and made it a centerpiece of Collision.

Punk's firing from AEW comes just two days before the All Out pay-per-view will be held in his hometown of Chicago. Saturday's episode of Collision will also emanate from the Windy City.

While Punk has received mixed reactions over the past couple of months, he is always cheered in Chicago, and it is fair to wonder if the fans will voice their displeasure over his termination.

In a possible effort to curtail that, AEW announced that Basketball Hall of Famer and Chicago Bulls legend Dennis Rodman will be present for Collision on Saturday night.

As the 44-year-old Punk departs AEW, it begs the question of whether he will end his wrestling career or attempt to continue elsewhere.

Punk was previously under contract with WWE from 2005 to 2014, and he established himself as one of the faces of the company, holding world titles on five occasions.

Although Punk did not leave WWE on good terms in 2014, it stands to reason that WWE could potentially be interested in a performer of his caliber.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
144,Title: Hulk Hogan Discusses Weight Loss After Abstaining from Alcohol for 8 Months,"Jerod Harris/Getty Images

WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan said this week that he has lost 40 pounds since giving up alcohol eight months ago.

Speaking to TMZ Sports, the 70-year-old Hogan said he feels great and that quitting drinking has allowed him to have a healthier diet as well:

""It changed everything,"" Hogan said. ""I wasn't eating late at night—I wasn't eating junk food anymore. I dropped like 40 pounds right away.""

Hogan noted that the impetus for his lifestyle change was that he was ""sick and tired of being sick and tired of myself.""

Known by his many nicknames, including The Immortal One and The Hulkster, Hogan was an active wrestler in five different decades from 1977 to 2012.

His greatest success came in WWE, as he won the WWE Championship for the first time in 1984, which set the stage for the hugely successful Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection and the creation of WrestleMania.

During his most notable WWE stints from 1983 to 1993 and from 2002 to 2003, Hogan was a six-time WWE champion and established himself as arguably the most recognizable pro wrestler in history.

Hogan was also the top star in WCW from 1994 to 2000, holding the WCW world title on six occasions. He also turned heel and served as the leader of the nWo, which helped WCW Nitro beat WWE Raw in the ratings for 83 consecutive weeks.

Due to numerous back surgeries, Hogan has not wrestled since 2012 when he was with TNA, and he currently serves as an ambassador for WWE.

Hogan has stayed busy lately, as he turned 70 last month and got engaged to be married to girlfriend Sky Daily in July.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
145,"Title: WWE Rumors on John Cena's Return, Rey Mysterio's LWO; Seth Rollins Talks Roman Reigns","Scott Ehler

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Cena Reportedly May Make Multiple PLE Appearances Upon Return

John Cena is set to make his WWE return on Friday night's episode of SmackDown, marking his first of many SmackDown appearances over the next two months.

Cena may not be confined to the blue brand, though, as PWInsider.com (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News) reported that there has been talk of Cena appearing at both the Payback premium live event on Saturday and Fastlane in October.

While it has yet to be confirmed, WrestleVotes reported Thursday that there have been ""rumblings"" about Cena serving as the host for Payback.

If that is indeed the plan, it could potentially be announced during Cena's SmackDown appearance on Friday.

When Cena last showed up at a WWE show, it was an unannounced segment at Money in the Bank in London, and it saw Cena call for WrestleMania to be held in London one day.

Cena was interrupted by Grayson Waller, who happens to have a Grayson Waller Effect segment scheduled for Payback with Cena's close friend, Cody Rhodes, as his guest.

If Cena potentially gets involved in that segment, it may be a way to set the stage for a match at Fastlane with Cena and Rhodes possibly teaming up to take on Waller and a partner, or simply just a single match between Cena and Waller.

Whatever the case, Cena is one of the biggest stars in WWE history, and it should be great for business having him back in the fold for an extended period of time.

WWE Reportedly Considering LWO Additions

WWE is reportedly considering an idea that would lead to the expansion of the LWO at some point in the future.

According to Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter (h/t Upton), WWE has discussed a long-term plan that would see Angel Garza and Humberto Carrillo join the group.

Once known as Los Lotharios, Garza and Carrillo have been undergoing a character change since getting sent back to NXT.

On this week's show, they ripped a Los Lotharios shirt and talked about the importance of coming from a famous wrestling family in Mexico, which suggests they will now be babyfaces committed to being champions.

While Garza and Carrillo figure to spend at least some time in NXT, joining LWO would be a sensible move once they are called back up to the main roster.

Led by Rey Mysterio, LWO has become a hugely popular stable in WWE with the former Legado del Fantasma made up of Santos Escobar, Zelina Vega, Joaquin Wilde and Cruz Del Toro turning face to aid Mysterio in his previous feud with Dominik Mysterio and The Judgment Day.

Joining that group would likely prompt the WWE Universe to embrace Garza and Carrillo as well, and it would immediately strengthen Garza and Carrillo as well.

For now, Garza and Carrillo are poised for a successful run in NXT, and it wouldn't be surprising if they manage to win the NXT Tag Team Championships at some point.

Rollins Discusses Difference Between Him and Reigns as Champions

WWE world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins compared himself and Roman Reigns during an appearance on After The Bell on Friday.

When asked about how he and his former Shield stablemate differ, Rollins discussed how his run as world heavyweight champion and Reigns' run as undisputed WWE universal champion are at different ends of the spectrum (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News):

""The one thing that I think kind of doesn't get talked about or flies under the radar a little bit, and I don't mean this as a knock on Roman's schedule of choice or anything like that, but the actual visibility of the championships. And I mean physically seeing the title in person, on graphics, on TV every week. ... It almost feels like Roman Reigns is the championship as opposed to Roman Reigns is the champion. Whereas Seth Rollins is wearing the World Heavyweight Championship. I am representing the World Heavyweight Championship.""

Reigns surpassed three years as world champion this week, further cementing one of the greatest title runs in WWE history.

As spectacular as his time at the top has been, Reigns does not appear on television every week, does not appear at every premium live event and only defends his title on occasion.

Conversely, Rollins is the inaugural world heavyweight champion, having beaten AJ Styles in a tournament final at Night of Champions in May.

Rollins is a weekly stalwart on Raw and has defended his title at PLE's on Raw and even on NXT during his relatively short reign.

In many ways, it felt like the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship was meant to create some balance in WWE since it allows a world title to always be present, even when Reigns isn't around.

Rollins has done an incredible job in that role, which is no surprise since he has long been one of WWE's top workhorses.

Both Reigns and Rollins are integral to WWE's success, but they contribute in different ways at this point in their respective careers.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
146,"Title: The B/R Wrestling Staff Predictions for WWE Payback, AEW All Out 2023 Match Cards","2 of 8

Rhea Ripley vs. Raquel Rodriguez

Is Raquel the right woman to take the title off Rhea?

From a physicality standpoint, Rodriguez is one of the most dominant female Superstars in WWE and would make a great SmackDown women's world champion at almost any other time in history.

Unfortunately for Rodriguez, Ripley is one of the most popular performers in wrestling and should remain at the top of the card until the company has a performer built up enough to take advantage of the moment. With more storyline and character development, Rodriguez could be that person, but not at Payback.

Samoa Joe vs. Shayne Taylor

Joe has had a long run as the TV champion. Do you think Shayne Taylor is the man to dethrone him?

For as much as Taylor has surpassed all expectations to become a very entertaining performer in the ring and on the mic, Samoa Joe is one of the best in the world at what he does.

Taylor will be made to look like a star against Samoa Joe, but the champion should successfully defend his belt and continue to carry AEW and ROH's weekly programming. We missed too much of Samoa Joe's career due to injuries, so he should remain on top as long as physically possible.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Revenge will be the name of the game Saturday when many of WWE's top Superstars mix it up at the Payback premium live event.

While big names like undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes are not scheduled for matches, plenty of talented performers will get the chance to show what they can do under the PLE spotlight.

Every bout on the card is a result of a heated rivalry, and some of the biggest prizes in WWE will be on the line in multiple matches, including the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and WWE Women's World Championship.

Here is a complete look at the Payback card, including the projected match order and analysis on the top contests to watch.

When: Saturday, Sept. 2 at 8 p.m. ET

Watch: Peacock

WWE Payback 2023 Match Card and Projected Order

Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship Steel City Street Fight: Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn (c) vs. The Judgment Day (Damian Priest & Finn Balor)

United States Championship: Rey Mysterio (c) vs. Austin Theory

Steel Cage Match: Becky Lynch vs. Trish Stratus

LA Knight vs. The Miz

WWE Women's World Championship: Rhea Ripley (c) vs. Raquel Rodriguez

WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Seth Rollins (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura

Top Payback Matches to Watch

Seth Rollins vs. Shinsuke Nakamura

In the likely main event of Payback, Seth Rollins will put the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on the line against a rejuvenated Shinsuke Nakamura.

Nakamura surprisingly turned heel on Rollins several weeks ago, and ever since that pivotal moment, The King of Strong Style has shown a renewed aggressive and violent side that had been missing for quite some time.

Adding to the intrigue surrounding the match is the fact that Nakamura has made it clear he intends to target Rollins' back, which Seth admitted is compromised due to some fractures he has been dealing with in recent years.

Assuming the hard-hitting version of Nakamura shows up to Payback, he and Rollins figure to put on a spectacular bout capable of capturing match of the night honors.

It also seems that Damian Priest could be a legitimate threat to cash in his Money in the Bank contract to close out the night based on the constant mentions of Rollins being at less than 100 percent.

Rollins figures to retain, but if Nakamura takes the fight to him and pushes him to his limits, don't be shocked if Priest is waiting in the wings.

Rhea Ripley vs. Raquel Rodriguez

For the first time since Night of Champions in May, Rhea Ripley will put her WWE Women's World Championship on the line at a premium live event Saturday.

Ripley has been a dominant force since beating Charlotte Flair for the title at WrestleMania 39, but her matches have been few and far between to keep her special, and most of them have occurred on Raw.

Since her last title defense, Ripley has been feuding with Raquel Rodriguez due to the fact that Rhea put both her and tag team partner Liv Morgan on the shelf with injuries.

Raquel recently revealed that she was finally medically cleared to compete, making her title match against Ripley official for Payback.

Ripley and Rodriguez are real-life friends, plus they showed great in-ring chemistry previously in NXT, so all the pieces are in place for a spectacular match.

Given that Raquel is one of the few women in WWE who can match Rhea in terms of strength, she should come off as a legitimate threat to take down The Nightmare.

Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn vs. The Judgment Day

After being the target of The Judgment Day's ruthless attacks for close to two months, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn will finally have a chance at retribution Saturday at Payback.

Owens and Zayn are putting the undisputed WWE Tag Team Championships they won at WrestleMania on the line against Damian Priest and Finn Balor, who have struggled to get along ever since Money in the Bank.

Balor has accused Priest of costing him the world title and worrying more about his status as Mr. Money in the Bank, whereas Priest has taken issue with Balor being distracted from The Judgment Day's goals by his friendship with JD McDonagh.

Ripley was fed up with the in-fighting on Raw this week and insisted that there will be changes within The Judgment Day if everyone doesn't leave Payback with a title in tow.

Given the lack of synergy between Priest and Balor lately, it seems likely that Owens and Zayn will take advantage and retain the titles.

The match itself should be highly entertaining due to the Steel City Street Fight stipulation, and what transpires between Priest and Balor will make for a compelling story worth following as well.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
148,Title: Champions Most Likely to Lose at WWE Payback and AEW All Out 2023,"Alejandro Salazar/PX Images/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

With plenty of drama inside the ring and behind the scenes in the wrestling industry over the last several weeks, fans have turned their attention to WWE Payback and AEW All Out.

Several big-name Superstars in both companies have held a championship for a long time, and a change in direction could be for the best. As the fall television schedule becomes packed with football and primetime shows, it is more important than ever to keep wrestling fans invested in the product.

And what better way to get people excited than by booking title changes? Here are the performers most likely to lose their championship this weekend.

MJF

Despite the storyline indicating it was time for Adam Cole to win, Tony Khan and his creative team found a way to make MJF and his challenger look strong and continue their friendship.

The unlikely partnership will be short-lived, though, as Cole should turn heel on the AEW world champion after he costs the duo the ROH World Tag Team Championship against The Dark Order on Sunday.

MJF has been gaining traction as a face, receiving positive reactions from the fans for his work as the good guy who still talks trash on everyone. One way to ensure the face turn works is to have Cole and his friends leave the champion a bloody mess in the middle of the ring.

In addition to successfully completing the double turn, AEW would build to an eventual rematch, likely coming after Cole uses heel tactics and help from his friends to win the Grand Slam World title eliminator tournament.

As fun as the run of Better Than You Bay Bay has been, just like Y2AJ, a short run as a tag team is all it takes to make an unforgettable blood feud.

Rey Mysterio

United States champion Rey Mysterio is one of the greatest luchadors ever to live, but his run with the United States Championship will be viewed as nothing more than a tool to further storylines at Payback.

Austin Theory is one of the brightest young stars in the business today, and he deserves a marquee storyline and proper character development. In a company that struggles in those two areas, holding a championship is the next best thing, and he should win the belt back from the popular face immediately.

The ultimate x-factor in this match is Santos Escobar, the leader of the Latino World Order. With WWE booking underlying tension between the two men, Escobar should interfere on Saturday and cost Mysterio the victory and the belt.

Not only would Theory be able to slink away as the heel champion who took advantage of the interference, but WWE would also set up a marquee storyline between Mysterio and Escobar, possibly for control of the LWO.

Orange Cassidy

When discussing the term workhorse in wrestling, names like Seth Rollins and Jon Moxley are the first to come to mind, but Orange Cassidy needs to be in that discussion after becoming a stalwart of weekly AEW programming.

On a week-to-week basis, few performers are positioned in such marquee spots and forced to put on show-stealing performances while defending a newer championship as often as Orange Cassidy.

While there is no question that OC has carried the AEW International Championship with honor and prestige—bringing legitimacy to a belt that meant nothing—the story is that he is physically breaking down and could be ripe for the picking.

With an eminent threat approaching in Moxley, someone who thrives on weakness and will smell blood in the water, Orange Cassidy should put up a good fight and another excellent performance, but he should lose the belt to the bigger name on one of the biggest stages.

Some may feel that Moxley is above a secondary championship, but it's as much about who OC loses the belt to as much as who carries it moving forward. After helping to carry the company for several months, Cassidy deserves to lose the title in a big-time match against one of the best in the world.

If OC must lose, it better be amazing.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

WWE legend and Hollywood star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and longtime talk show host, author and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey announced the creation of the People's Fund of Maui to benefit those impacted by the recent wildfires in Maui on Thursday.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, The Rock said he and Oprah are starting the fund with a donation of $10 million, and he encouraged others to donate as well:

The Rock noted that one of the features of the fund is that any impacted adult in the Lahaina and Kula areas of Maui County will be eligible to receive $1,200 per month while recovering from the devastation.

Earlier this month, wildfires raged through the Hawaiian island of Maui, killing at least 115 people and leaving many others missing or displaced.

The Rock was born in Hayward, California, in 1972, and moved frequently due to the lifestyle of his father, WWE Hall of Fame pro wrestler Rocky Johnson.

He spent plenty of time in Hawaii, not only because of his father's commitments, but also because his mother's side of the family founded and ran the NWA Polynesian Pro Wrestling promotion on the islands.

The Rock's grandfather, WWE Hall of Famer Peter Maivia, primarily ran the company until his death in 1982, and then his grandmother, Lia Maivia, was in charge through the promotion's closure in 1988.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

The issues that occurred at All In between CM Punk, Jack Perry and AEW management may have affected one of the top young stars on the roster more than anyone, according to Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful Select.

Ricky Starks was discussed for a big match at All Out this Sunday. The match would be for Punk's ""Real"" World's Championship and was considered to main-event the show.

Now, with Punk suspended and considerable uncertainty surrounding the top of the card, Tony Khan has taken to advertising a potential showdown between Starks and 70-year-old Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat in a Leather Strap match.

Steamboat last worked a match on a big stage in 2009, when he feuded with Chris Jericho and worked some house shows for WWE against a young Drew McIntyre.

He was extraordinary in those outings but that was well over a decade ago and asking him to get in the ring with a young, main event-worthy star in his prime is likely unfair at this point.

It could all be a red herring, with Khan figuring something else out on the fly, but it is interesting that he would even hint at the possibility if that wasn't the direction he was leaning toward.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

The stage has been set for The Judgment Day to take over WWE before long. However, the current make-up of the group will need to change as they have not been able to win consistently together.



The main man on the verge of leaving the faction is Finn Bálor, who has been working more with JD McDonagh lately over his own stablemates. He could be planning to create another group of his own.



However, Damian Priest has shown more signs of turning face of the two. He has been respectful of Seth Rollins as champion and chosen not to cash in when he could have.



Bálor and The Archer of Infamy are tagging together with the hope of capturing tag team gold on Saturday, but it's unlikely Rhea Ripley will allow both to continue in The Judgment Day if they fail.

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from the WWE Universe.

Belair Reportedly Taking Scheduled Time Off

WWE reportedly wrote Bianca Belair off television recently for some scheduled time off, although it is not known how long she will be gone.

According to Fightful Select (h/t Felix Upton of Ringside News), the Damage CTRL attack that focused on Belair's knee on the Aug. 18 episode of SmackDown was meant to write The EST out of storylines for the time being.

Fightful noted that the knee injury is not legitimate, and it is simply a means to keep Belair off TV during her planned hiatus.

While Belair's status is unclear in that regard, sources were unsure how long Belair would be gone, telling Fightful she could be out of action anywhere ""from a few weeks to possibly three months.""

Belair has been a true workhorse in the WWE women's division since getting called up to the main roster a few years ago with nary a break, so she has undoubtedly earned a bit of time off.

At SummerSlam, Belair won a Triple Threat match against Asuka and Charlotte Flair to become a three-time women's champion, but her celebration was short-lived, as Damage CTRL member Iyo Sky successfully cashed in her Money in the Bank contract to become the new champion.

Given that Iyo and Bayley were responsible for her storyline injury, Belair figures to target them when she returns and renew the rivalry she had with Sky a few months ago.

Until then, it will be up to the likes of Damage CTRL, Asuka and Flair to carry the workload for the SmackDown women's division.

Woods Not Medically Cleared For Raw Next Week

New Day member Xavier Woods said Tuesday that he is not medically cleared to be at next week's Raw after taking a chair to the face this week.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Woods wrote that he had been looking forward to wrestling on his birthday, which is Monday, Sept. 4, but since he is suffering from whiplash, he won't be back until the following week:

It is unclear if Woods' injury is legitimate or part of a storyline, but he was involved in a shocking spot on this week's Raw when Drew McIntyre hurled a chair from the announce table at his head.

From a storyline standpoint, McIntyre was aiming for Viking Raiders member Erik, but missed and hit Woods instead.

McIntyre and Riddle were ringside for the New Day vs. Viking Raiders match due to their recent issues with Erik and Ivar, and The Viking Raiders took advantage of the opportunity to take a cheap shot at them.

Later in the show, Kofi Kingston walked out of the trainer's office, and McIntyre apologized for the mistake. Kofi accepted the apology on behalf of Woods and said he knew Drew wasn't trying to hurt his tag team partner.

Next week on Raw, McIntyre and Riddle are set for a match against The Viking Raiders, and based on Woods' tweet, it sounds as though New Day won't have any involvement.

R-Truth Says He's Returning from Injury Soon

Longtime WWE Superstar R-Truth may be nearing his return from injury after missing the past 10 months.

Per PWStream, R-Truth said Tuesday on a TikTok livestream that he is set to return to WWE ""in the near future.""

Truth has not been seen on WWE programming since the Nov. 1 episode of NXT when he suffered an injury during a loss to Grayson Waller.

One week after suffering the injury, Truth announced on social media that he had torn his quad and needed to undergo surgery:

Truth later divulged in January that he had to undergo a second surgery after suffering an infection as a result of the first surgery.

The 51-year-old Truth is one of the longest-tenured performers in WWE, having been on the roster since 2008. He actually made his WWE debut under the name K-Kwik in 2000, but he was released in 2002 and spent some time in TNA before returning.

Truth has long been a beloved figure in the world of pro wrestling both by fans and his peers due to his infectious personality, and it has been sorely missed on WWE programming.

Despite being over 50 years of age, Truth was still performing at a high level prior to his injury, so he will be a major return to the roster when he is cleared to compete.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Cena was once the focal point of SmackDown, rising to prominence with the blue brand before rocketing into the stratosphere as WWE champion and the industry's top star.

He was able to do that because a preview generation, such as Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Edge, Rey Mysterio, Undertaker, Booker T and John Bradshaw Layfield readied him for that role.

Cena has since made a career of getting guys such as Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, Daniel Bryan and the late Bray Wyatt ready to run atop WWE as the next crop of industry greats.

Now, the future WWE Hall of Famer has the opportunity to use his considerable star power to give two of the most promising young stars in the company a ""rub"" while signing off on the hottest star in professional wrestling.

Cena has already lent his credibility to Austin Theory, elevating the former United States champion by putting him over in the opening contest of WrestleMania 39. In his only other premium live event appearance of 2023, he shared the spotlight with Grayson Waller at Money in the Bank.

As the top heels on SmackDown in the absence of The Bloodline, Theory and Waller can wrap up their rivalry with the LWO's Rey Mysterio and Santos Escobar as soon as Saturday's Payback and transition into a program with Cena and a tag team partner of his choosing.

Enter, LA Knight.

The Megastar arrives at the final quarter of 2023 as the hottest star in WWE, thanks to a fanbase that has been behind him for months. His pops are as loud as anyone's on the main roster, and his push has caught up recently.

A signature win at SummerSlam in the Slim Jim Battle Royal, a feud with WWE standard-bearer, The Miz and an emotional moment under the most difficult of circumstances during the Bray Wyatt memorial episode of SmackDown, has Knight on par with Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins for recognition as the company's most beloved babyface.

Having the 40-year-old legitimized by way of an on-screen partnership with Cena, ending with a momentous sign of approval, would go a long way in confirming the fans' insistence that the self-proclaimed Megastar is what he says he is.

Validating his popularity via public acknowledgment, while working with Theory and Waller in a weeks-long program that would spotlight them at the top of the card, would help Cena ensure the blue brand has performers it can feature prominently for the future.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
154,Title: Dana White Denies 'Crock of S--t' Rumors on WWE's Ronda Rousey Fighting at UFC 300,"Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images

UFC president Dana White denied a rumor Tuesday that Ronda Rousey wants to return to the promotion for a fight at UFC 300.

Per TSN's Aaron Bronsteter, White blasted the Daily Mail report, saying: ""Stop reading the Daily Mail, everything that they write is a crock of s--t.""

White added: ""Ronda's having kids! Ronda built this whole thing that's going on with the women here, then her dream was to go to the WWE. She went there and did everything that she did there and achieved. She's made s--t loads of money. She's moved on with her life.""

On Sunday, Sadie Whitelocks of the Daily Mail reported that one of Rousey's ""confidants"" said:

""She just had a match at SummerSlam and is looking to wind down her time and commitments with the WWE, and she is now focusing on potentially making a run to have one last fight in the UFC and compete at UFC 300 when that presents itself sometime next year.""

The source added that Rousey also wants to have a second child with husband and fellow former UFC fighter Travis Browne, which could alter her supposed plan to return to MMA for UFC 300.

Rousey, 36, started as a star in judo, winning a bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. She later transitioned to MMA, becoming one of the biggest stars in the history of the sports.

She began her pro MMA career a perfect 12-0 with nine submissions and three knockouts, including a 6-0 mark in UFC.

Rousey was awarded the inaugural UFC women's bantamweight title and she defended it in dominant fashion before a shocking knockout loss to Holly Holm at UFC 193 in 2015.

Just over one year later, Rousey returned to the Octagon to fight Amanda Nunes at UFC 207, losing by first-round technical knockout.

That prompted Rousey to step away from MMA and pursue another dream by becoming a professional wrestler for WWE.

Rousey accomplished a great deal during her two WWE stints from 2018 to 2019 and 2022 to 2023, winning the SmackDown Women's Championship twice and both the Raw Women's Championship and WWE Women's Tag Team Championships once each. She also won the 2022 women's Royal Rumble match.

Most notably, Rousey was part of the first women's match to ever main event a WrestleMania, facing Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair in a Triple Threat at WrestleMania 35 in 2019.

Rousey lost an MMA rules match against longtime friend Shayna Baszler at SummerSlam earlier this month, and she later took to Instagram and wrote: ""[Shayna Baszler], you were the reason I got into this business… Now I got no reason to stay.""

That has led to the belief that she is indeed done with WWE, at least for now, which would possibly open up a path for her to return to UFC.

Given how big of a draw Rousey returning to UFC would be, however, it seems likely that White would be more enthusiastic about the idea if he truly thought it had a chance of happening.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Knight Wants to Mix It Up with The Rock

LA Knight is open to locking horns with a WWE legend who he has often been compared to during his recent ascent.

Knight has history with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, as he appeared on his reality show entitled The Hero in 2013, and many parallels have been drawn between them in recent months as fans have gotten firmly behind Knight.

Speaking to Joe Brophy of TalkSport this week, Knight was asked about possibly having a promo battle with The Rock on WWE programming at some point, to which he responded: ""If that happens then we gotta do something physical, right?""

Knight alluded to the fact that The Rock got him with his famous, ""It doesn't matter"" catchphrase one time on The Hero, and he noted that he would like to exact some revenge: ""I don't mind dropping the Rock on his head! I owe him one from about 10 years ago when he hit me with, 'It doesn't matter,' 10 years ago, so I owe him a little something.""

Currently, Knight is embroiled in a rivalry with The Miz during which Miz has accused Knight of being a cheap imitation of Attitude Era stars such as The Rock and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin.

On Monday night's episode of Raw, The Miz dressed up like Knight and impersonated him on the mic to show how ""easy"" it was to appeal to the fans.

At WWE Payback on Saturday, Knight and The Miz will clash with bragging rights on the line.

A segment or match with The Rock may be a dream scenario for Knight, but with the SAG-AFTRA strike in Hollywood compelling John Cena to return to WWE for an extended run, it may not be outside the realm of possibility that The Rock could show up in the near future as well.

Rhodes Talks Lesnar's Reputation Among Fans

Fresh off his rivalry and series of matches with Brock Lesnar, Cody Rhodes cleared up a common misconception regarding The Beast Incarnate this week.

During an appearance on After The Bell (h/t WrestlingInc's Eric Mutter), Rhodes shot down the notion that Lesnar doesn't have a love for pro wrestling and is only in it for the money:

""Every one of us has a perception and a reputation in the space that we're in, in the sports entertainment/wrestling space. There are people who think they know us personally, and describe events as if they were there. I'm not complaining about it, it's the nature of fame. There's a deep connection. I believe he [Lesnar] has a reputation that is incorrect, in terms of the type of person he is, as far as, 'Does he even like wrestling? Does he care about wrestling? How professional? Does he train?' All of this.

""You don't get to be where he's at unless you are very, very passionate about this. And I like the idea that ... I've never spoken to him, we aren't friends. But I like the idea that he's fine with this reputation.""

Since returning to WWE in 2012, Lesnar has largely worked a part-time schedule, making sporadic appearances, wrestling at big events and then taking an extended period of time off.

Because of that, a portion of the wrestling fanbase has often questioned Lesnar's passion and wondered if he just comes around to collect a paycheck.

While financial compensation is undoubtedly a big reason why Lesnar has stuck around for so long, it is clear that he also takes pride in his performances based on how entertaining he has consistently been when in the fold.

Brock's rivalry with Cody was a perfect example, as they clashed in three quality matches, including the best of the bunch at SummerSlam.

Lesnar was dominant in that match, but he also made Rhodes look great and put him over in a big way taking the loss and shaking The American Nightmare's hand afterward.

Ospreay to Consider All Options After NJPW

Will Ospreay isn't ruling out anything ahead of the impending expiration of his New Japan Pro-Wrestling contract.

Ospreay told Christopher Walker of DAZN in April that his NJPW contract is up in February 2024, meaning he will be free to potentially sign with AEW or WWE when the time comes.

While Ospreay has already worked extensively with AEW, perhaps making it the leader in the clubhouse to sign him, it sounds as though Ospreay will give consideration to WWE and other potentially interested parties as well.

During an interview with Cultaholic (h/t Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News), Ospreay said: ""I'm open to all options, that's all I can say.""

AEW has a working relationship with NJPW, which has led to the former IWGP world heavyweight champion working multiple matches for AEW.

Most recently, Ospreay defeated Chris Jericho at All In over the weekend in London, taking down one of the all-time greats in his home country of England.

There are many more huge matches possibly on the horizon for Ospreay in AEW, but there is no shortage of dream matches available to him in WWE as well, including bouts with Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, among others.

Ospreay is widely regarded as one of the best in-ring workers in the world, and it is fair to assume that every major wrestling company would love the opportunity to sign him.

Ospreay seemingly realizes that there will be wide-ranging interest, which is why keeping his options open is a wise move.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Rhea Ripley doesn't partake in actual matches often, so when she does, it's sort of a big deal now.

In fact, there's a certain Roman Reigns-type vibe around the Australian's usage that is downright awesome. She's quickly transcending the sport of pro wrestling itself into the mainstream, and her prominent role in The Judgement Day makes that usage smart.

Schism followers grabbed Brutus Creed and carried him away, leaving Julius Creed alone against Jagger Reid and Rip Fowler.

Brutus finally got back into the match in time to hit a Brutus Bomb and side-by-side low clotheslines with his brother to win.



Steel cage matches have become very similar over the years, but it's obvious everyone involved wants to do something unique. This match never relied on the escape option or had anyone but the competitors step inside the structure.



From keeping Brutus out of the action for a while to the use of the cage door as a weapon, this match was wild and built to a furious climax that had the fans on their feet.



These teams have always had great chemistry, but this was their best match together and likely their last. It was one of the best matches on NXT television in a while.



The balance in NXT is restored, and the brand has a chance to put The Creeds back in title contention. Hopefully, the Schism story is over for Diamond Mine.

158,Title: WWE Legend Batista Stars in New Trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 Video Game,"Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images

WWE legend and successful Hollywood actor Dave Bautista starred Tuesday in the trailer for the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 video game.

In the trailer, Bautista plays the role of a librarian who develops powers and introduces a new era of Mortal Kombat:

The Mortal Kombat video game franchise burst onto the scene in 1992 when Midway produced the arcade game, which was later ported to home consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Mortal Kombat reached even greater success and popularity with the release of Mortal Kombat II in 1993, and it has maintained its place as one of the most iconic video game franchises in the world ever since.

The upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 will be the 25th Mortal Kombat game ever released across all platforms, and the first for consoles since Mortal Kombat 11 in 2019.

Bautista was a natural fit for the Mortal Kombat trailer due to his experience in professional wrestling, combat sports and the world of acting.

Under the name Batista, he wrestled in WWE from 2002 to 2010, and also had shorter stints with the company in 2014 and from 2018 to 2019.

He became one of the most decorated Superstars in WWE history as a four-time world heavyweight champion, two-time WWE champion, four-time tag team champion and two-time Royal Rumble winner.

Bautista officially retired from in-ring competition in 2019, and he is a WWE Hall of Famer in waiting, as he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2019, but has yet to be officially inducted.

In addition to his excellence in pro wrestling, Bautista has become a huge star in Hollywood, most notably playing the role of Drax the Destroyer in the Guardians of the Galaxy series.

Mortal Kombat 1 will be available in stores and digitally on Sept. 14 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

LA Knight kicked off his career year by feuding with Bray Wyatt.

Friday night, he paid homage to his rival, thanking him for getting him ready for the position he finds himself in before battling fellow Wyatt foe, Finn Balor.

The main event was a good, solid pro wrestling match that highlighted Knight against a top heel and allowed him to score a definitive victory over a former Universal champion.

His tribute to Wyatt, promo on The Miz ahead of their match at Payback, and the crowd's reaction to all of it came together to result in the most significant utilization of Knight as a potential main event star in WWE yet.

He was the guy on this episode and the crowd accepted him in that role, even under the difficult circumstances surrounding the broadcast. On a tough night, he rose to the occasion and that is something the backstage powers that be absolutely took notice to.

The Miz came out to LA Knight's theme song dressed like him and gave a promo while doing an impression of The Megastar.

Once the crowd started getting into it, The A-Lister took off the outfit and started ranting about how the crowd will cheer for anything and how anyone can pander.

The next match saw Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods take on Erik and Ivar. These two teams have been in the ring together many times, so this was by no means a fresh encounter. Drew McIntyre and Matt Riddle watched from the commentary table.

Woods and Erik started with a nice exchange. The Vikings took control and isolated Woods for a bit, but it didn't take too long for Kingston to help his partner turn things around.

Valhalla was at ringside but didn't have much of an impact on the action.

This ended up being a relatively standard tag team match for the most part. The pace was steady and they had good chemistry.

The contest devolved into mayhem at ringside when McIntyre and Riddle got involved, and this led to Erik and Ivar hitting Ragnarok for the win.

The conclusion to All In with MJF and Adam Cole remaining friends and hugging it out may have been viewed as a disappointment to some, but it was also the smartest call AEW could have made.

It would have been easy for the company to end the evening with either Cole or MJF turning on the other and walking away as AEW world champion. Instead, it was left open-ended with Cole's refusal to cheat being what cost him the title, and MJF interpreting his post-match actions as Cole never wanting to be genuine friends in the first place.

Both men have played their respective roles remarkably well throughout this storyline. There's no one predictable path AEW will take with it, which makes whatever comes next with them post-All In all the more compelling.

163,Title: Report: Ronda Rousey Eyes UFC 300 Return to Final Fight amid WWE Exit Rumors,"AP Photo/John Locher

As Ronda Rousey's time in WWE appears to be coming to an end, she reportedly could be preparing for a return to the UFC for a marquee event.

Sadie Whitelocks of DailyMail.com spoke to ""one of the 36-year-old's confidants,"" who said Rousey is eyeing a comeback at UFC 300 in early 2024.

""She just had a match at SummerSlam and is looking to wind down her time and commitments with the WWE and she is now focusing on potentially making a run to have one last fight in the UFC and compete at UFC 300 when that presents itself sometime next year,"" the source said.

Rousey hasn't fought in MMA since she lost to Amanda Nunes by first-round knockout in 48 seconds at UFC 207 in 2016. She has largely stayed away from the UFC since then, except for an appearance when she was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2018.

Dave Meltzer said last month on Wrestling Observer Radio that Rousey has a ""hard out"" when her WWE contract expires (h/t Ian Carey of F4W Online). She faced Shayna Baszler at SummerSlam and lost, and that is believed to be her last match for the company.

It should be noted that MMA journalist Ariel Helwani reported last month that Rousey was ""not considering a UFC comeback"" and there was ""no truth"" to a rumor that she was preparing for a potential return. However, with Nunes retiring and vacating her bantamweight and featherweight titles earlier this summer, perhaps now is the best time for her to make her way back to the Octagon.

The source also told Whitelocks that Rousey is ""at a current crossroads in her life and career as she is looking to see what she might want to do next,"" with television and film roles considered to be ""a big focus"" for her.",2023-09-16,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
164,Title: 5 Predictions for WWE Payback and AEW All Out During Wild Wrestling Week,"3 of 6

One of the biggest criticisms of WWE and AEW recently has been the lack of time afforded to their women's divisions.

WWE had the opportunity to present a SummerSlam card that featured three women's matches but decided to leave two of its biggest stars off of the lineup by opting not to book Becky Lynch vs. Trish Stratus.

AEW had six hours of airtime to work with at All In at Wembley Stadium in London and presented just one women's match, which was, predictably, the shortest on the card.

When asked about the booking decision in the post-show media scrum, Tony Khan brushed it off, insinuating that a second match would have adversely affected the flow of the PPV.

For Payback, WWE has announced the feud-ending showdown between Lynch and Stratus inside a steel cage and a battle between former friends as Raquel Rodriguez challenges Rhea Ripley for the Women's World Championship.

Over on All Out, Kris Statlander defends the TBS Championship against Ruby Soho on Sunday.

Based on recent trends and the dismissive attitude of AEW's owner and head booker with regard to women's wrestling in his company, there is not a high probability that another match will be added to the lineup. Even if it is, time will likely be at a premium.

Still, three matches over the course of two shows should have fans of those involved excited.

Lynch and Stratus are top-notch talents who won't struggle to get time for their match. Barring a flare-up of the knee injuries that have limited her in-ring appearances of late, Ripley and Rodriguez should tear the house down if presented 10 or so minutes.

With an as-of-now relatively small card for All Out, Soho and Statlander should have plenty of time to work with, but no one would be surprised if that wasn't the case given the circumstances.",2023-09-16,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Cena has also been confirmed as Seth Rollins' tag team partner for a match against Imperium's Giovanni Vinci and Ludwig Kaiser at the WWE Superstar Spectacle event in India on Sept. 8.

It's unclear if Cena's run will continue into November and December, but this is set to be his most regular string of appearances in years. He's wrestled just once this year, losing to Austin Theory at WrestleMania 39, after making only one in-ring appearance during the 2022 calendar year.

In 2021, Cena wrestled at several house shows and dark matches to get himself in ring condition for his Universal championship match against Roman Reigns at SummerSlam. He's not been a regular on weekly television since his acting career began taking off.

Cena has several film projects currently in limbo as the SAG-AFTRA strike continues. The strike is the likely impetus for Cena to make his way back into the squared circle, as actors are not promoting films being released or making new shows/movies at this time.

166,Title: WWE Rumors on Shane McMahon; Updates on Mercedes Moné Injury and Dudley Boyz Reunion,"Noam Galai/Getty Images for Ideanomics

Bleacher Report catches you up on the latest news from WWE and AEW.

Shane McMahon Not Returning Anytime Soon

The last Shane McMahon return did not go as planned. When he made a surprise return at WrestleMania 39 to confront The Miz, McMahon suffered a torn quad and needed Snoop Dogg to help save the segment.

Snoop filled in admirably and dropped a People's Elbow on The Miz in one of the event's most viral moments, but it was a disappointing moment for McMahon, who was making his first WWE appearance since the 2022 Royal Rumble.

Do not expect a return from that injury anytime soon.

Mike Johnson of PW Insider reported McMahon is unlikely to return until at least after the close of Endeavor's purchase of WWE. Endeavor revealed last month that it plans to take control of WWE by mid-to-late September, combining the company with UFC to form TKO Holdings.

It's unclear why McMahon's return would be tied to Endeavor, but a torn quad is typically an injury that takes several months to heal regardless. It would be a surprise to see him any time before next year's Royal Rumble.

That said, it would be an even bigger surprise if we never saw Shane-O-Mac in a ring again. There's almost no way he'll want to finish out his in-ring career with what happened at WrestleMania.

Mercedes Moné Not Yet Cleared for In-Ring

While there were no big surprises or debuts at AEW's All In pay-per-view, there was one notable name in the crowd who made headlines.

Mercedes Moné, known as Sasha Banks in WWE, was shown in the crowd and was prominently featured on the screen several times. There has been no confirmation about Moné working with AEW, and Tony Khan was adamant that the seven-time world champion is not cleared for action during his media scrum.

""I thought it would be great to have her here to see all the matches, including the AEW Women's World Championship [match], but she's not cleared [to wrestle] since her injuries,"" Khan told reporters. ""I just thought it would be good to have her to take in the show. [There's] definitely a lot of potential things [that] could happen there, and I know that New Japan Pro-Wrestling's had great experiences working with her.""

Moné suffered a severe ankle injury in May when she faced off with Willow Nightingale at NJPW Resurgence. No timetable has been given for her return, and she reportedly signed a deal with New Japan for more dates before the injury.

The strong working relationship between AEW and New Japan would mean there's unlikely to be a problem if Moné worked for both companies. However, until we see her name with an All Elite graphic, it's worth waiting to see whether anything happens.

Team 3D to Reunite for Impact Taping

Impact is pulling out all the stops for its 1,000th episode, and that includes reuniting one of the greatest teams in wrestling history.

The company announced Bully Ray and D-Von will team up for the Sept. 9 episode of Impact against yet-to-be-named opponents.

The Dudleys have not tagged together since a House of Glory event in 2016. D-Von retired following that match to serve as a backstage producer for WWE. In January, D-Von departed WWE but was yet to make his in-ring return.

Bully Ray has been semi-active in recent years but has been a regular in the ring since returning to Impact last July. He's wrestled 14 matches for Impact alone this year.

During his most recent run of matches in WWE, Brock Lesnar looked like he was in incredible shape. While there was some speculation that the 46-year-old could be gearing up for a return to UFC, it sounds like that's not the case.

UFC president Dana White was asked by Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated if there's any chance Lesnar would make a comeback for the upcoming UFC 300, and he said he thinks the WWE Superstar's MMA career is over.

""I think Brock's done,"" White said. ""I don't think he ever comes back.""

Lesnar owns the distinction of being one of two fighters to compete at UFC 100 and UFC 200. However, his fight against Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in 2016 was ruled a no-contest after Lesnar tested positive for a banned substance. He hasn't been seen in the Octagon since.

Instead, the former UFC heavyweight champion brought his dominance back to WWE and he was most recently embroiled in a feud with Cody Rhodes that culminated with a match at SummerSlam last month. Lesnar lost the match and is expected to take some time off before returning to the ring.

With John Cena's return to WWE scheduled for the Sept. 1 episode of Friday Night SmackDown, it's safe to assume the show will serve as a set up for the just-announced tag match he will take part in at the India premium live event.

WWE announced on Sunday that Cena will be teaming up with world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins to take on Imperium's Ludwig Kaiser and Giovanni Vinci at the WWE Superstar Spectacle on Sept. 8.

WWE previously reported om Aug. 21 Cena would be making his return to the company for the first time since WrestleMania 39.

WWE has a cluster of shows in a short period of time that it has to promote. Payback takes place on Sept. 2 with five total matches announced thus far.

Rollins may not be world heavyweight champion by the time he teams up with Cena. He is defending his title against Shinsuke Nakamura at Payback.

This is the second title match taking place at the Superstar Spectacle. The Indus Sher duo of Sanga and Veer, accompanied by Jinder Mahal, will challenge Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn for the undisputed tag team championships.

The Sept. 8 event will also be the second Superstar Spectacle event, but the first in front of a live crowd. The inaugural one aired on Jan. 26, 2021, India's Republic Day, and was taped at the Thunderdome.

This will be Cena's third match since Dec. 30, 2022. He previously teamed with Owens to defeat Zayn and Roman Reigns on an episode of SmackDown.

170,Title: It's Time For Rhea Ripley to Become the Roman Reigns of WWE's Women's Division,"Gladys Vega/ Getty Images

Not to cramp John Cena's style or anything, but Rhea Ripley's time is now.

Now, with the 2023 edition of Payback on approach and Ripley's Judgment Day all over the promotional posters and such, is the perfect time to begin the catapult to Roman Reigns status.

Some might give an eye-roll at the idea, understandably. But there are few budding Superstars in pro wrestling flirting with the ability to transcend the sport itself and become household names in pop culture (seriously, pop open Tik-Tok for five seconds on a new account and Ripley is bound to show up).

And Payback currently lacks a certain amount of punch for a PLE. Seth Rollins will fight Shinsuke Nakamura for a title. Ripley has the title match against Raquel Rodriguez. Fans are finally getting Becky Lynch-Trish Stratus, but it's been dragged out to the point of getting a muted reception.

In many ways, Payback has the vibe of SummerSlam lite—unless it's a vehicle for Ripley.

Few would argue against the idea that Ripley is the best thing running in Judgement Day. Dominik Mysterio comes close, but he's not there yet, nor does he possibly hold up all that well without Ripley right now.

Which is the point. Payback might be the time to have Ripley split off from Judgement Day in some fashion, playing into that beef between Finn Balor and Damian Priest over the latter's Money in the Bank briefcase and the happenings around it.

Maybe that could mean Ripley takes Mysterio with her on the way out, forming a bit of a secondary stable that keeps them in the heel zone. It would certainly be interesting, for example, to see Ripley take on this sort of cult-like figure within WWE who other heels flock to and join. The first choice might be right there at Payback with Nakamura too, never mind the chance to help revive someone like Austin Theory.

But rumblings and buzz from not too long ago suggested that internally, WWE views Judgment Day as a sort of successor to the Bloodline around Reigns. That sort of frames it as the next big long-running storyline centered around a critical piece. That would be Ripley.

Looking at the calendar, this sort of stable shakeup that elevates Ripley even further comes at the perfect time, too. Fans have entered that purgatory situation before the build to the next WrestleMania can start in earnest. So with the Bloodline on a mini-break of sorts, why not have Ripley lead a team of heels at Survivor Series to take on past allies and otherwise?

It's a rather large onion from a long-term development standpoint too. Position Ripley as the break-away piece and maybe, in the next six months to a year, an eventual split with Dominik that leads to his really becoming the main event player and title holder we all know he's going to be.

Similar story for the women's division, where WWE continues to struggle. Not in the talent sense—not by a long shot. But the company seems to have major issues with figuring out how to handle veterans like Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch and even Bayley while also giving up-and-coming talents room to breathe and shine. Ripley serving as a Reigns-styled final boss of sorts who will eventually lose and provide career-altering momentum for someone else seems too obvious to mess up.

And hey, maybe WWE is well ahead of everyone on this front. One of the surefire complaints with Ripley right now is how little she actually wrestles. But maybe that's a sign. It is, after all, one of the bigger complaints with Reigns' title run too. Maybe she's already viewed on that level and that's how things will continue to play out in a measured manner.

We can't undersell the idea of Ripley having actual matches against men too, when the time comes and it makes sense storyline-wise. Those feel inevitable, especially if WWE follows this proposed track of Payback planting the seeds for and/or kickoff a stable shakeup.

More matches would be nice, but as Bloodline has repeatedly shown, big storyline payoffs are much better. That faction's tale has felt like a bit of a proof of concept for WWE as far as committing to long-form storytelling, too.",2023-09-16,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
171,Title: Most Important WWE and AEW Booking Decisions for Rest of 2023,"Ronald Martinez/Getty Images

With record-breaking ticket sales across both WWE and All Elite Wrestling, it's clear the sport is back in a big way, but both companies must build on that momentum for the rest of 2023.

WWE Creative has several major decisions to make over the coming months, including when and where to take the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship off Roman Reigns.

And Tony Khan and his team must decide whether now is the right time to give Adam Cole the AEW World Championship and end the reign of MJF in front of a raucous crowd at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday.

For both companies, the rest of the year should also be spent focusing on the women's divisions, which lack elite storytelling and character development despite the huge amount of talent on both rosters.

Here are the most important booking decisions for WWE and AEW throughout the remainder of 2023.

Let Reigns Keep Winning

There is no doubt that the storyline involving The Bloodline and Reigns has been one of the best in recent wrestling history, but while the champion's run with the title is growing repetitive, WWE should not abandon ship on his reign just yet.

Instead, it should double down and invest more time and Superstars in the storyline, keeping it fresh enough to carry through the Royal Rumble. The company should let the winner of the men's Battle Royal challenge Seth Rollins, while The Tribal Chief stands unopposed until one man returns to dethrone him at WrestleMania 40.

And that man would be The Rock.

With The Great One returning to the ring to take back the throne and stake his claim to being the head of the table, the defending champion would slowly descend into madness after losing the belt that feeds off his inability to beat his cousin.

As for The Rock, allowing Cody Rhodes to eventually dethrone him for the world title will be a memorable moment that catapults The American Nightmare into the upper echelon of all-time performers.

Give Adam Cole the AEW World Title

While WWE should continue its run with their top champion, Maxwell Jacob Friedman should lose to Adam Cole at AEW All In at Wembley on Sunday night.

The storyline of Cole and MJF begrudgingly becoming friends after an unlikely bedfellows tournament has been genius, producing some of the best AEW content of the year and getting people to invest heavily into the storyline.

Instead of letting MJF turn on Cole as everyone has predicted since the start of the storyline, the challenger should see every heel tactic from the champion coming a mile away and be the ultimate deceiver in the relationship, reversing the dastardly tactics with his own.

With the former NXT star continuing through the rest of 2023 as world champion, MJF could remain a heel, frustrated that someone got the upper hand on him.

Cole desperately needs a marquee victory, and walking out with the belt would put his career back on track after injuries derailed his momentum.

With a crowd at a fever pitch, ready for something huge to enjoy, watching MJF try to screw over Cole, only to find out that his new friend had been playing him all along, would be the perfect ending to a historic night.

Care About Women's Wrestling

No matter what happens at All In, All Out, Payback or any of the remaining pay-per-views this year, Triple H and Tony Kahn must look inward and realize that women's wrestling matters more than they have shown.

There is far too much talent across both companies for the lack of storyline continuity and character development in the women's divisions each week.

In WWE, even the most important names such as Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Ronda Rousey are left without marquee matches or programs that properly utilize their talents.

In AEW, the company has hired a plethora of talented in-ring performers and mic workers, but the week-to-week output of the division has been lackluster at best. Look no further than the up-and-down nature of The Outcasts and their angles as a prime example of the inconsistency in commitment from the creative side.

Through the rest of the year—then at all times moving forward—each company should invest more time and energy into its women's division and give these talented performers the stage they deserve.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
172,Title: Bray Wyatt's Lasting Impact Goes Far Beyond the WWE Ring,"Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images

Today, the world mourns the loss of one of the most unique and innovative wrestling characters of the last decade, Bray Wyatt.

It's fair to say there was no one else in the industry like him. In an era where fans know more about backstage happenings and work rate is highly regarded, the three-time world champion dared to be different.

While some see professional wrestling as a combat sport, the 36-year-old saw it as an art form and he prided himself on taking risks. His ambitious approach to sports entertainment made him one of the most provocative and memorable superstars to grace a WWE ring.

Everyone remembers that euphoric moment that initially drew them to wrestling. More to the point, we all can recall that instance when we realized it wasn't real. Even if you continued to watch it, that realization changed the way we viewed our beloved pastime forever.

Wyatt is one of the few individuals who could momentarily transport us back to that time when wrestling was new and make us believe again. He captured the imaginations of viewers all over the world because he embodied his character with such conviction.

When he entered an arena, Wyatt transformed the onlookers into an endless sea of fireflies. When he spoke, we all stopped what we were doing and paid attention.

As we consider the legacy he leaves behind, the connection he created with the audience will supersede any of his matches or the usual talking points. He was a once-in-a-lifetime performer and, as of today, he still has the whole world in his hands.

A Tremendous Career Filled With What-Ifs

On Aug. 24, WWE Chief Content Officer Paul Levesque announced that Wyatt, real name Windham Rotunda, unexpectedly passed away.

The news shocked the wrestling world on Thursday night as fans and his peers took to social media to pay tribute to the third-generation star. More importantly, the people who knew him best spoke glowingly about the man behind the enigmatic figure

Straight away, it became abundantly clear how much he meant to so many people. It's still hard to process this revelation because we all thought he would eventually return to the ring later this year.

The 36-year-old made his final appearance for the company during the Feb. 17 episode of SmackDown. Then, he abruptly went on a hiatus ahead of WrestleMania 39, where he was scheduled to face Bobby Lashley.

During that time, Rotunda reportedly struggled with ""heart issues"" following a bout with COVID-19. After six months, Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful revealed that he was close to finally getting cleared to return last weekend.

Yes, The Man of 1,000 Truths took his fair share of criticism after the Mountain Dew Pitch Black match at Royal Rumble. However, there was still hope that he could adapt and reinvent himself again.

After all, reinvention was the hallmark of his storied career. As cliche as it sounds, he bet on himself many times and his loyal fans would always go along for the ride.

Nobody's favorite member of The Nexus went to NXT and reemerged as The Eater of Worlds. The Wyatt Family and his spellbinding promos and unequivocal presence elevated him into a star who had the potential to lead the pack.

When that run ran its course, he flipped the world on its head again with the introduction of The Fiend and The Firefly Fun House. After WWE released him in 2021, he had us all chasing a white rabbit ahead of an awe-inspiring return at Extreme Rules last year.

Despite all the talk of what-ifs or poor booking decisions, you just couldn't count him out because he would always find a way to draw us in again. Even if it would take some time, we expected him to prove all his detractors wrong again, and that's what makes this such a tough pill to swallow.

Wyatt overcame many rejections and obstacles and came out the other side as a larger-than-life character. It seems so cruel for his career to end on this note and leave us with even more questions about what could've been.

An Indelible Legacy That Transcends The Sport

Nevertheless, Rotunda unquestionably left his mark on the industry over 14 years. Championship wins and five-star matches will never define him or the lasting impact he had on all of us.

His true gift to pro wrestling was the way he made you feel. It's the infectious spirit of defiance that welled up inside of us when we heard the Miss Teacher Lady promo for the first time or the pride longtime fans felt as he cut his first promo as WWE champion in 2017.

It's the child-like stupefaction that The Fiend's debut elicited and the laugh-out-loud moments the absurdity of his work created. His self-deprecating humor and winks and nods in the Firefly Fun House segments brought us in on the joke like so many modern fans crave.

He garnered intense reactions from his loudest critics and his most staunch defenders. That's the mark of greatness. Whether you loved him or hated him, he made you feel something, and you'll never forget that.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
173,Title: Remembering Bray Wyatt: The Best Matches and Moments in Unforgettable WWE Career,"10 of 10

There would be no LA Knight as we currently know him without Bray Wyatt.

That may seem like a loaded statement and one that diminishes Knight's accomplishments to this point, but one look at where that character was in late 2022, early 2023 and it becomes pretty obvious how integral Wyatt was to the elevation of the Megastar.

A rivalry that started with some typical Knight trash-talking escalated from there, involved the new Uncle Howdy persona and culminated in the Mountain Dew Pitch Black Match at Royal Rumble in January.

The match was the surreal, supernatural, spooky match fans had come to expect out of Wyatt but it was less about the quality and presentation than it was what it meant for Knight.

A star of Wyatt's stature, a three-time world champion who had mixed it up with legitimate Superstars like John Cena and The Undertaker, did not have to work with Knight. He could have scoffed at working with a dude who was looking to establish himself on the main roster after the disaster which was the Maxx Dupri stint with Maximum Male Models.

Wyatt not only worked with him but his credibility helped enhance Knight's star and served as the launching pad for the run we are currently experiencing now.

No one could have known it at the time but the last full program Wyatt worked on gave back to the industry, providing the foundation for a breakout star who may be uber-talented and have an enormous personality made for the big time, but who needed that nudge from a guy fans already trusted to really get him on his way.

The feud also provided a defining moment for Wyatt when he shared the ring with Undertaker.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
174,"Title: The Rock, John Cena, Wrestling World React to WWE Star Bray Wyatt's Death at 36","Photo credit: WWE.com

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and John Cena were among the many pro wrestling superstars and luminaries to remember and honor Windham Rotunda, also known as Bray Wyatt, following his death Thursday at the age of 36.

WWE head of creative Triple H announced the news of Wyatt's death Thursday, leading to an outpouring of love and support from others in the sports entertainment industry:

Perhaps the most notable name to contribute was The Rock, who is not only one of the top legends in WWE history, but one of the most recognizable actors in Hollywood.

The Rock provided some heartfelt words regarding Wyatt on X, formerly known as Twitter, in addition to another pro wrestling legend in Terry Funk, who died Wednesday at the age of 79:

The Rock had a memorable encounter with Wyatt and The Wyatt Family at WrestleMania 32 in 2016 when they interrupted his promo.

Johnson and Wyatt had an entertaining promo battle of their own, and The Rock proceeded to beat Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan in an impromptu match.

Fittingly, Cena was also involved in that segment, as he helped The Rock fight off the Wyatts. That marked one of the many times Cena and Wyatt worked together on the Grandest Stage of Them All.

Wyatt was one of Cena's greatest on-screen rivals. Cena recognized that fact in his post, noting that Bray ""brought the best"" out of him:

Cena defeated Wyatt at WrestleMania 30 in what was the biggest match of Wyatt's career to that point, as he had debuted on the main roster less than one year earlier.

More recently, Cena and Wyatt met in one of the most unique contests in WrestleMania history, facing off in a Firefly Fun House match at WrestleMania 36 in 2020.

Both Cena and Wyatt showed off their acting chops and delivered a never-before-seen performance, and it was Wyatt who ended up in the win column.

In addition to The Rock, Cena and Triple H, several other current and former WWE Superstars made their feelings known regarding Wyatt over the past two days as well, including Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, Bayley, Saraya, Alexa Bliss, The Miz and Matt Hardy:

Wyatt will go down as not only one of the most creative minds in WWE history, but in the entire existence of the pro wrestling business.",2023-09-16,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
175,"Title: Boxing betting preview: Zhang vs Joyce 2, Hitchins vs Zepeda, more","Publication Date: 2023-09-21 00:00:00

Revenge is on the cards this weekend in London as Joe Joyce looks to even the slate over “Big Bang” Zhilei Zhang.

Zhang stopped the “Juggernaut” in its tracks in April via sixth-round TKO and this result has pumped value into the pre-fight favourite back in spring, Joyce.

Joyce comes into value at 11/10

It’s impossible not to regard a Joyce win as a pick of the week at 11/10 | +110 considering his positioning in the heavyweight division.

Zhang was heavy-handed and precise in damaging the eye of the Briton back in April to get the W, but as a 4/1 | +400 underdog before this fight, we can’t ignore the pre-conceived gulf between these two.

Joyce is durable in the traditional sense. We can’t bank on his eye becoming a factor in this rematch again, so at 11/10 | +110, it’s a cracking price to presume Joyce can tweak a few things on home soil, keep his eye intact and ride the Zhang waves of aggression.

This is a betting preview, so this isn’t to suggest that this is a foregone conclusion in the way of a traditional fight pick – it’s just to say that Joyce’s price at above Evens is well worth a look.

Backing Zhang to win this fight as a 10/11 | -110 FAV is a really tough sell when you could have got him at 4/1 | +400 a few months back.

A Joe Joyce win on the scorecards sits at 3/1 | +300 which also feels generous. Joyce will have to start a lot faster in this rematch, but if he is able to outland the away fighter in the opening exchanges, then a safety-first approach could prevail in the latter rounds.

Joyce’s long amateur schooling should enable him to box and move when necessary, but going 12 rounds for only the second time in his career could prove the biggest hurdle.

3+ knockdowns in the fight is a monster 11/1 | +1100 which can often be worth a small stake when the heavyweights are in town.

Benn returns under a cloud

We’ll keep this one short and sweet.

Conor Benn has been crowbarred back into action this weekend in Florida under the Texas State Athletic Commission with just a few days notice in order to avoid media scrutiny.

He is a massive 1/20 | -2000 to beat Rodolfo Orozco and this price is worth ignoring as much as the contest is.

How good is Richardson Hitchins?

Richardson Hitchins is on the super-lightweight warpath and opens up as a 1 /4 | -400 FAV against the experienced Jose Zepeda this Saturday night.

This is an excellent step-up for the 25-year-old who will get the gut-check he has been calling out for against a 4/1 | +400 underdog in Zepeda.

Zepeda won’t make it easy for the prospect. There are still plenty of question marks over the head of the Matchroom fighter and Zepeda has experienced every style of fighter in the super-lightweight class.

I’m not quite sticking our neck out for a big upset here, but a Jose Zepeda KO at 8/1 | +800 is a monster price and, if we’re being honest, probably worth covering to some degree.

Hitchins will probably get over the line, but wouldn’t be worth chucking into an accumulator at 1/4 | -400.

Upset of the week?

Steve Rolls isn’t a bad fighter. Okay, he also isn’t world class, but I honestly can’t consider Ammo Williams to be a 1/8 | -800 FAV considering the struggles he has faced recently outside of the ring.

Rolls ran Edgar Berlanga close and got a good win over Shady Gamhour in 2022 and at 8/1 | +800 is worth a look.

176,Title: Highlights and results: Batyr Jukembayev split decision win over Roldan,"Publication Date: 2023-09-20 00:00:00

A split personality main event ended up a split decision on ProBox TV tonight, as Batyrzhan Jukembayev and Hugo Roldan gave us a frustrating hybrid of a wild action fight and a tedious Greco-Roman wrestling match.

Jukembayev (21-1, 16 KO) had to climb out of a hole after taking either a flash or balance knockdown midway through the 1st round. Roldan (22-2-1, 7 KO) frustrated him with unusual attack angles, and more than a little bit of leading with the crown of his head. Jukembayev found his counter timing in the 3rd, sniping Roldan on his attempted bull-rushes and wobbling his legs. Roldan did a lot more holding after that, and the fight degenerated into brief bursts of action between extended holds and tangles.

No warnings on the holds from the referee, who also had a very generous interpretation of slips vs. knockdowns. Roldan was down on ruled slips in the 2nd, 7th, and 10th rounds, all of which were some degree of debatable, though the rulings were at least consistent. The headbutts from Roldan also opened a cut over the eye of Jukembayev in the 8th round, but no warnings were issued.

Roldan’s shoes fell apart midway through the fight, and had to be taped together between the 4th and 5th round because the soles were separating from the tops of the boots. It didn’t compromise Roldan’s movement, but that free and easy movement may have cost him the fight. Official scores were 97-92 for Roldan, overruled by 96-93 and 95-94 for Jukembayev. Roldan’s decision to fight the 10th as though he already had the fight in pocket probably cost him the decisive point, and the 95-94 scorecard might have swung the other way if Roldan hadn’t fled from engagement throughout the closing round.

For what it’s worth, BLH had it unofficially 97-92 for Jukembayev, who did more and better work throughout. Here’s the knockdown, the best and cleanest highlight from this one.

Kareem Hackett UD-10 Clay Waterman

Unanimous victory for Kareem Hackett in the chief support, who mixed slick hands with what could generously be described as lumbering footwork to win all but one round from a single judge. But that functional, if not graceful, movement from Hackett (12-0, 6 KO), combined with good boxing at range, was enough to control this fight from start to finish.

Clay Waterman didn’t create many inside opportunities, and didn’t manufacture much with what he got. Even sequences that looked good for Waterman (11-1, 8 KO) in real time showed Hackett slipping and dodging when replayed between rounds. Hackett never really pushed for the early finish, even after a nice series in the 7th where he bent Waterman’s head backwards with a pair of big shots.

We did get a little dance-off near the end of the 6th round. Enjoy it!

Ismael Villarreal TKO-2 John David Martinez

The opener was a feeling out 1st round, then a three-knockdown triumph for Ismael Villarreal in the 2nd and final. Not a lot of resistance from John David Martinez here, as he went to the canvas repeatedly without taking anything that looked like a disorienting power punch. Villarreal improves to 13-1 (9 KO), while Martinez falls to 19-3 (16 KO) with the TKO stoppage after knockdown number three.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
177,Title: 'We're Targeting Mid November.' Oscar De La Hoya Talks Ryan Garcia's Return,"Publication Date: 2023-09-19 21:20:02-04:00

By: Sean Crose

“We’re targeting mid November,” Oscar De La Hoya said to Fight Hype in a recently published interview. “We’re having ongoing discussions with his team. We’re having ongoing discussions with DAZN, and we’re nailing down a venue and opponents. Then we’ll hopefully announce very soon.” De La Hoya and his team are “targeting” mid November for the return of the highly popular Ryan Garcia. Although the young Californian suffered his first loss – via knockout at the gloved hands of Gervonta Davis – his last time in the ring, De La Hoya feels it’s time to start thinking of Garcia’s return.

“Anywhere Ryan goes he will fill up an arena,” said De La Hoya. “All we do as promoters is try to navigate what’s best for his career, so he can get to the top, to the elite top.” De La Hoya was asked if the legal battle he’s been having with Garcia – who claimed to be unhappy with the way De La Hoya and company had been handling his career – had come to a satisfying conclusion. “I can’t really talk about what’s going on now, but everything will be resolved,” he said. “I just feel we had a little bump in the road but everything will be smoothed out.”

De La Hoya went on to indicate that Garcia has certainly done well for himself fighting under De La Hoya’s Golden Boy Promotions’ banner. “He’s right there,” De La Hoya said of Garcia. “He’s a bona fide true star in boxing…he just did over two million homes on pay per view with Gervonta Davis for a reason.” What’s more, De La Hoya also indicated that the defeat to Davis shouldn’t end up being too damaging to Garcia’s overall career. “Yes, he’s coming off a loss,” he said of Garcia, “but you’re as good as your last fight. So, if we get him back on a winning streak he will be back on top of the world.”

Although he’s recently suffered his first loss, De La Hoya believes there could be a big event for Garcia in the near future. “There’s a huge weekend,” he said, “Super Bowl Weekend…and we’re talking to some people, and I strongly feel that the only fighter who can headline such an event would be Ryan Garcia.” Of course, a fight of that size would mean Garcia would have to fight a top or at least well known opponent. “Obviously it all depends on the opponent,” De La Hoya said. “It has to be for a world title. It has to be a big name (Teofimo Lopez and Adrien Broner were two of the names mentioned during the course of the interview).

“He’s still in the driver’s seat,” De La Hoya said of his fighter, making it clear Garcia remains one of the biggest names in the sport.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
178,"Title: Surprise, Surprise: Conor Benn Will Return To The Ring This Saturday","Publication Date: 2023-09-20 21:29:07-04:00

By: Sean Crose

“I am undefeated in the ring, and in spirit.” So says Conor Benn, an individual who has made the transition from a notable fighter to a nearly notorious fighter thanks to a failed drug test which lead to the cancellation of a much anticipated bout with Chris Eubank Jr last spring. Benn will nonetheless be fighting in the co-main event of the Richardson Hitchins – Jose Zepeda fight this weekend in Florida. The 21-0 Benn’s opponent will be the 32-3-3 Rudolpho Orazco. “A return on Saturday is a step closer to redemption,” says Benn. “After that, I’m putting the 147-160 divisions on notice. You are looking at a determined man with a deep desire to beat them all.”

Although Benn’s return to the ring has led to the raising of eyebrows, Matchroom Boxing, which promotes Benn, claims he “was subsequently cleared in July by UKAD and the WBC,” after his most recent failed test, “and his provisional suspension was lifted after an independent National Anti-Doping Panel review.” Matchroom honcho Eddie Hearn is bullish on his fighter’s return. “Conor Benn is back,” he claims, “and I’m looking forward to seeing him pick up where he left off. He’s ready to go straight in for a big fight now but his trainer Tony Sims will be pleased to get him back sooner against a game opponent in Rodolfo Orozco.”

The widely unknown Orozco, is of course pleased by the recent turn of events. A surprise win over Benn, after all, could catapult the mans career. “This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for,” Orozco says. “This isn’t short notice for me because I’ve been preparing for this moment my entire life. You’ve made a mistake Conor, and I’ll show you that this Saturday.”

Naturally, not everyone is happy with the fact that Benn is returning to the fight game. Indeed, Britain’s Boxing Board of Control, has, along with UKAD, appealed the National Anti-Doping Panel’s ruling in favor of Benn. Sure enough, Hearn has indicated to Talk Sport that he now believes Benn will henceforth be viewed as one of the sport’s bad guys. A lot of money, however, can be earned playing the heel. Hearn has also indicated that he’s expecting big things of Benn after this weekend. Yet the future remains somewhat cloudy for Benn, who will be facing Orozco this as a junior middleweight.

The Daily Mail reports the fighter’s “return to the ring has been confirmed for Saturday night in Orlando – despite the unresolved doping case that could yet see him banned from the sport.”",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

Next week’s Canelo Alvarez vs Jermell Charlo show has a pretty robust undercard by current standards. Sadly, today’s release of the full bout sheet reveals that said depth doesn’t extend to the pre-PPV portion.

At the top sits Canelo training partner Frank Sanchez (22-0, 15 KO), who fights his second straight joke of an opponent in Scott Alexander (17-5-2, 9 KO). Alexander lasted less than 120 seconds against Zhilei Zhang two fights back, so while he’s a slightly warmer body than Daniel Martz, he’s yet another dud in Sanchez’s bafflingly bad post-Ajagba run.

Gabriel Gollaz Valenzuela (27-3-1, 16 KO) also returns to action for his second straight Canelo card, having previously won a questionable and potentially corrupt decision over Stevie Spark. He faces what looks like an easier assignment in Colombia’s Yeis Gabriel (15-0, 10 KO, who hasn’t fought in nearly two years after dropping a split decision to Alberto Palmetta.

Oleksandr Gvozdyk (19-1, 15 KO), who stopped Ricards Bolotniks on Canelo-Ryder, takes a step backwards on the comeback trail against Brazil’s Isaac Rodrigues (28-4, 22 KO). Rodrigues is 38 and managed to take three cumulative rounds on the scorecards in a February loss to Richard Rivera.

Terrell Gausha (23-3-1, 12 KO) also stays busy in a middleweight bout with KeAndre Leatherwood (23-8-1, 13 KO), his second appearance since a surprisingly competitive loss to Tim Tszyu last year.

Logan Paul's fiancée, Nina Agdal, has been granted a temporary restraining order against Dillon Danis requiring him to abstain from posting sexually explicit images of her on his social media accounts, per TMZ Sports.

Danis had been given two weeks to file opposition paperwork after the Sept. 7 decision and failed to do so, meaning the restraining order has now gone into effect.

The judge in the case ruled that Danis continuing to post such imagery of Agdal could result in ""irreparable emotional distress and reputational harm if Defendant continues to post such photographs on the internet.""

Agdal sued Danis for his repeated posts of her in the lead-up to his fight with Paul.

As of Wednesday, Danis has continued targeting Agdal in his social media posts.

Danis, 30, is scheduled to face Paul on Oct. 14 in the second main event at MF & DAZN: X Series 10—The Prime Card. KSI facing Tommy Fury will be the other main event.

Interim WBC super middleweight champion David Benavidez reportedly has a date set for his second title defense.

According to ESPN's Julius Julianis, Benavidez will face Demetrius Andrade with the title on the line on Nov. 24 on a PBC on Showtime pay-per-view.

Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) is coming off a unanimous decision victory over Caleb Plant in March. He claimed the interim WBC title in May 2022 with a third-round TKO of David Lemieux.

The 26-year-old is one of the rising young stars of the sport and could be on track for a showdown against undisputed super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez if he gets past Andrade. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman recently said Benavidez has been tabbed as the mandatory challenger for Alvarez at 168 pounds. Alvarez is set to defend his titles against undisputed light middleweight champion Jermell Charlo on Sept. 30.

Andrade (32-0, 19 KOs) is a former two-weight world champion who held the WBO middleweight title as recently as 2022. He vacated the title last August over his refusal to defend it against Janibek Alimkhanuly. He was set for an interim super middleweight title fight against Zach Parker that would've put him in line to face Alvarez, but he pulled out of that fight as well.

Mario Barrios will get another crack at joining the top ranks at 147 lbs when he faces Yordenis Ugas in a 12-round bout on the Canelo vs Charlo PPV undercard on Sept. 30.

The 28-year-old Barrios moved up to welterweight in early 2022, losing a decision to former titlist Keith Thurman before beating Jovanie Santiago in February of this year. He says he’s now feeling good at the weight, having come up from 140, and starting his serious career down at 130.

“I’m gonna bring the same intensity that I bring in every fight. I feel a lot more comfortable and settled in at the weight now,” Barrios said at a media workout.

“I’m preparing myself to the best of my ability. We have a very good game plan that we’re getting ready for Ugas. It’s a really hard fight, but those are the type of fights that I like to take. I want to continue to test myself and my ability and my skill in the ring.”

Barrios (27-2, 18 KO) and Ugas (27-5, 12 KO) will be fighting for the interim WBC welterweight title, and that win could lead to a full title if undisputed champ Terence Crawford moves up in weight.

“A win in this fight means everything for me and my career right now,” he said. “It puts me at the top of the division with the best welterweights out there and gets me closer to the bigger world title fights.”

184,Title: Is Canelo Alvarez Slipping Enough For Jermell Charlo To Win?,"Publication Date: 2023-09-20 02:45:55-04:00

By Dan Ambrose: Canelo Alvarez has clearly slipped a little in the last two years to where he was in 2021 when he captured the undisputed super middleweight championship, but he’s not lost enough for him to lose to Jermell Charlo on September 30th.

Bernard Hopkins is giving Jermell an 85% chance of beating Canelo, which sounds crazy because he has so much stacked against him.

Canelo has the size and power, and you got to figure he’ll get the nod from the judges for any close rounds due to him being the Face of Boxing.

Jermell’s best chance of winning is by knocking out Canelo, and that’s unlikely to happen. Alvarez has never been knocked out or even dropped during his career, and he’s been in with much bigger punchers than Charlo.

The Mexican superstar Canelo (59-2-2, 39 KOs) has the technical knowledge that creates huge problems for Jermell (35-1-1, 19 KOs), who will be coming up in weight two weight classes and giving away weight.

Ultimately, what could hurt Jermell’s chances of winning the fight is his 17 months of inactivity. That’s way too long to be out of the ring for a fighter hoping to upset Canelo, especially a guy needing to go up 14 lbs to try and achieve that.

Canelo still wins

“I’m picking Canelo to win this fight for a number of reasons. I agree. We’re going to have very competitive spots in this fight. Charlo is really good. I’ve been a fan of his for a long time, especially offensively,” said Chris Algieri to ProBoxTV, picking Canelo Alvarez to defeat Jermell Charlo.

“His offense is very beautiful. He’s got really good style and technique, and he’s a prototypical boxer/puncher. He’s got really good boxing technique, and he can punch really well, and he’s become a really good puncher/finisher in the second half of his career,” said Algieri.

Jermell has looked good against the opposition he’s faced, but he’s not fought any elite-level fighters during his long 16-year pro career. He’s glided through a long career fighting exclusively B & C level fighters and has never stepped it up against dangerous guys like Canelo.

Jermell’s best opponents:

Austin Trout

Jeison Rosario

Brian Castano

Tony Harrison

Erickson Lubin

Vanes Martirosyan

Demetrius Hopkins

Gabriel Rosado

Denis Douglin

“But in analyzing these two guys in this fight, I’ve become a lot more excited in this fight, feeling Charlo is going to be very competitive,” said Algieri.

“Has Canelo slipped? Sure. He’s 33. Father Time is real. He’s had a very long career. We always talk about chronological age vs. ring wear. I believe the man turned pro at 15-16 years old, and he’s been in a lot of long fights. He’s been in tough fights.

“He’s got great defense, which is a testament to his ability, but a lot of training camps and a lot of sparring. He’s an old 33 when it comes to wear & tear on his body for a boxer.

“But as far as 85% chance of him winning, I just don’t agree. Bernard, I respect the hell out of you, but I don’t agree with that. Does he have a chance to win? Absolutely. If Charlo does win, I don’t want people to blame Canelo for slipping because the man is jumping up two weight classes. He’s been inactive,” said Algieri.

85% chance of Jermell is wacky, and you got to wonder if Hopkins has his feet firmly planted on the ground, coming up with that estimate.

Charlo does have a chance of winning, particularly if Canelo performs like he did in his last two fights against John Ryder & Gennadiy Golovkin. Canelo blamed his hand injury for his off performances in those fights, and perhaps he’s right. If not, he could lose to Jermell.

Jermell deserves credit if he wins

“He’s jumping up two weight divisions to fight the face of the division in this biggest stage possible,” said Algieri. “If he gets the win here, I’m not blaming it on Canelo slipping. I’m blaming it on Charlo being an all-time great.

“To be an undisputed in two weight classes. He’s undisputed at 154. The two men [note: Jermell only beaten once in his career, not twice] to beat him, he returned to defeat them by KO. That’s a big deal. So he’s beaten every man that he stepped foot in the ring with.

“If he goes up two weight classes and beats Canelo Alvarez to be undisputed in two weight classes, already he’s historic. So, let’s not start the narrative that Canelo is slipping. So if Charlo is to get the win, let’s not take his flowers away before he gets them,” said Algieri.

Jermell will certainly get credit, but it won’t necessarily be historic, given how poor Canelo has looked in his last three fights.

A lot of boxing fans forget how much punishment Canelo took in his loss to the much bigger WBA light heavyweight champion Dmitry Bivol last year.

Canelo took a bad beating in that fight and ate punches from a fighter that he had no business being inside the ring with. The reason Canelo hasn’t looked good lately may be a result of the beating he took from Bivol.

If that’s the case, Jermell has a chance of winning if he doesn’t get clipped. Canelo’s power is still quite formidable, even if he is shot.

Alvarez not naturally bigger

“Canelo has been bigger at this weight longer than Charlo. He’s stepping up in that way, Charlo is,” said Teddy Atlas. “Let’s not forget that Canelo is not naturally this size. Canelo started a lot lower than he is now.

“He started at 140 pounds, then he went to 147, then he went to 154, and then he went to 160. He picked his spots really well because when you’re the guy when you’re the chosen one, you can pick your spots better than someone like Chris Algieri, who had to fight whoever they put in front of him at that time and make the most of it.

“So, I’m just saying that when we talk about the weight, I back off that a little bit because Canelo is not the naturally bigger guy. He’s become the bigger guy, but I don’t know that he’s the naturally bigger guy,” said Atlas.

Jermell looked a lot bigger than Canelo during their kickoff pressure conference when the two stood for a face-off. If Jermell puts on a lot of weight for the fight, he could enjoy a size advantage inside the ring on the night, and that should make it interesting.

“I favor Canelo, but will it be a competitive fight? Will it be a better fight than people first thought it was going to be when they first made the fight?’ said Atlas. “Yeah, I think so. Will it be a fight where Canelo will have moments where he’ll have a difficult time with Charlo? I think maybe so, yeah.

“85%, no, I’m not buying that. Does he have a chance to win? Yes, of course, he has a chance to win. If you put a gun to my head, I probably pick Canelo by split decision. It sounds good.

“85%, that’s a real chance. I don’t know if I give him 85, but I would agree with Bernard, believe it or not. Of course, Canelo is the golden boy, the engine that drives boxing. He gets all the favors; he gets all the gifts if there has to be a gift given out. He’s going to get it,” said Atlas.

Canelo slipping

“Again, he’s the guy that brings the money and lays the golden eggs. He’s been good,” Atlas continued. “I think he’s been overrated and made into a little bit more. I think he’s lost a few fights in his career. I think he lost to Lara. I definitely think he lost his first two to GGG, but I digress.

“That’s water under the bridge. I do think he’s slipping. I think he’s shown. You got to remember this guy has been a pro since he was 16. He’s been around a long time.

“I do think he’s slipping. He showed it in his last couple of fights against guys a couple of years ago; he would have gotten rid of, especially in his last fight,” said Atlas.

You can’t blame Canelo for not knocking out John Ryder because this guy has a steel chin, and he’s been in with Callum Smith, a guy with arguably better power than Alvarez. Ryder wasn’t dropped by Smith. Against Canelo, Ryder was knocked down in the fifth round and in bad shape.

“Bivol is a different thing,” said Atlas. “Bivol is just a great fighter, a tremendous fighter, a tremendous technician. But he exposed him in some way. His fights after that showed some slippage. I agree with Bernard.

“Charlo has problems, too. He has been inactive, but he might have a little more juice in the tank, a little more lively right now than Canelo is at this period of his career,” said Atlas.",20 in 2004,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
185,Title: Canelo Alvarez: 'You'll See I'm The King Of Boxing' After Charlo Fight,"Canelo Alvarez is adamant about reclaiming his crown and throne as boxing’s best fighter.

After winning the undisputed super middleweight title in 2021, Alvarez (59-2-2, 39 KOs) has had a three-fight stretch featuring a loss to Dmitry Bivol at light heavyweight and workman-like unanimous decision wins against Gennadiy Golovkin and John Ryder.

The 33-year-old has also been dealing with injuries, as he underwent left wrist surgery last fall after the Golovkin fight.

Alvarez’s next test arrives later this month when undisputed super welterweight champion Jermell Charlo (35-1-1, 19 KOs) will jump up two weight classes to challenge the Mexican star on September 30 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Showtime pay-per-view.

“Boxing-wise, I wasn’t 100 percent. But critics are always looking for something, aren’t they? And obviously, I agree with them, that I haven’t looked the last few fights like I used to. And I don’t want to just give a rebuttal. I’d prefer to show them. And in this fight, you are going to see the difference,” Alvarez said on the second episode of Showtime's docuseries ""All Access.""

“I can't wait for September 30. This fight, you'll see I'm the king of boxing.”

Alvarez was the 2021 fighter of the year and universally considered the sport’s pound-for-pound best fighter until Bivol bullied him last year to a unanimous decision loss.

To prepare for Charlo, Alvarez moved training camp near a high-altitude abode in Lake Tahoe, California, and now he’s finally recharged and ready to deliver a turn-back-the-clock performance, he says.

“He's a fighter that hits hard. He's a good boxer that knows how to use distance. That's what makes him dangerous,” said Alvarez.

“This is one of the best camps I've ever had in every sense. How calm I am, how we've been training. I've been training at 100 percent. This helps me stay focused on the fight and will give me confidence when it's time to fight.”

186,"Title: ‘He’s quit once, he’ll do it again’: Tyson Fury talks Oleksandr Usyk and new career goals","Publication Date: 2023-09-19 00:00:00

Tyson Fury appeared on Queensbury Promotions social media account to discuss a number of topics, including his upcoming bout with Francis Ngannou, his dear pal Oleksandr Usyk, and his new career aspirations. Check out some of what Fury had to say below.

Fury on Dubois’ low blow on Usyk

“I’ve been boxing all my life, two-time heavyweight world champion and lineal champion, second longest reigning lineal champion in history. It wasn’t a low blow. It was on the belt. And anything below the belt is low. When we go into the ring, when we fight, sometimes I have my shorts up high and the referee will say ‘Waist is high, Tyson. Anything here is okay, anything below that is illegal.

“But we all know that wasn’t a low blow. Usyk got beat fair and square. Fair and square he lost by knockout. Knockout for a body shot. It crippled him. And I just feel highly, highly sorry for Daniel because he should be the unified champion right now, on course to fight me for the biggest payday his life will ever see. And I feel sad for him.

“So, that’s boxing. It won’t be the first time someone’s been fucked out of something, and guarantee it won’t be the end of it. And that’s just the world we live in and unfortunately that’s the way the cookie crumbles.”

On if he believes Usyk is vulnerable to the body

“I don’t know if he’s vulnerable to the body or what. The face is vulnerable too. The body is like a quit. I saw something in Usyk the other day, he quit. He quit like a little bitch. And then moaned about it and cried about it and got up after five minutes.

“So he’s quit once already in my opinion. And what do I know, I’m only a world heavyweight champion, undefeated for 15 years. So, yeah, he’s quit once, he’ll do it again for sure. But I feel sorry for Dan. Dan beat him fair and square. Hit him on the belt line which is not below the belt...make no mistake, he lost that fight.”

On what he wants to do with the rest of his career

“Now I’ve got new goals, though. So everyone’s fucked. I want to top the Forbes list, highest paid athlete ever, for the year, and I want to make a Hollywood movie. So, yeah, new goals.

“I’ve completed the ring game. It’s fucked. It’s done. Done everything there is to do, won every belt there is to win and I’ve been undefeated in 15 years and two-time undefeated champion. So hopefully I get through Ngannou and then I’ll either fight Ngannou in a cage or I’d fight Jon Jones in a boxing match.”",37 in 2021,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

188,Title: ‘I think Canelo is slipping’: Virgil Hunter says Jermell Charlo has a real shot to win fight,"Publication Date: 2023-09-19 00:00:00

Trainer Virgil Hunter takes some time to chat with Marcos Villegas of Fight Hub TV to talk about the big upcoming fight between Canelo Alvarez and Jermell Charlo. Hunter shares some of his analysis on the matchup, and why he thinks Charlo has a good chance to win if the fight gets into the later rounds. Check out some of what he had to say below.

Hunter on how he views Canelo vs Charlo matchup

“I think Canelo is slipping. I think he’s very hittable. I think he only throws one or two punches. I think the stamina problem is right there. Jermell is much more durable than Amir, has much more punching power and I think Canelo is showing some slippage ‘cause he seems to be able to throw one or two punches at one time. And from what I understand he lives a pretty party lifestyle also.

“So money can do some strange things to you, man. When you been fighting as long as he has, from a kid and things like that, and the ego is there, you can start bypassing things, you can lose the hunger. And when the hunger’s gone the skills start going. So I think if he gets tired against Jermell, and Jermell shows great ability late rounds, that it could be a problem if he lets it get on the other side of seven, eight. It could be a problem.

“I don’t see Jermell standing there and letting him get bombs off on him. I think it’s gonna be a very interesting fight and I don’t think weight has much to do with this. I think it’s gonna be skill and I think if Jermell can hit with authority enough to get his respect, that’ll be an interesting fight. That’s the whole key.”",11 in 2019,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
189,"Title: ‘Honestly, it’s very frustrating’: Shakur Stevenson irked by inability to land top lightweights","Publication Date: 2023-09-18 00:00:00

During the latest episode of Brian Custer’s The Last Stand Podcast, Shakur Stevenson talks about the recent bad news that his fight with Frank Martin won’t be happening after all and his inability to get other big names to fight him, including Vasiliy Lomachenko and Devin Haney. Check out some excerpts of what he had to say below.

Stevenson on why his fight with Martin fell apart

“I think Frank Martin got cold feet. I think that before the fight was signed it sounded good, everything sounded good, but once the fight came to fruition I feel like he got real nervous and didn’t want to fight no more.

“But his excuses and his reasoning, he will tell you that it wasn’t enough money. But truthfully speaking, it was quadruple more than he’s ever made in his entire career. And that’s a fact.

“The numbers he done made in his career was — the highest — was $250,000. That fight that he would’ve just fought, he would have fought for a world title and he would’ve fought for a million dollars or so.”

On why he believes Martin would pull out of an agreed fight

“I don’t think fighters want to lose. I think that deep down inside he know that I’m one of the best fighters in boxing. And like I said, I don’t think he wanted to lose when it came down to it. If he’s gonna take an L he want to make ten times more than he ever made in his career. I guess four times is not enough.”

On Martin suggesting maybe Stevenson should’ve accepted less money to make the fight

“My problem with what he said was — you shouldn’t speak on nobody else situation if you don’t know the details. So when he went and said stuff about me and not knowing my situation, not knowing the details of what happened in the situation, it just turned around and slapped him in the face.

“Plus, my situation and his situation were two different situations. I’m a fighter. I love boxing, I love to fight. I would never turn down quadruple more than I ever made for a world title (shot). Would never do that.”

On his frustrations about not being able to get top fighters around his weight class to fight him

“I mean it’s very, very, very frustrating. It’s stressful, frustrating. I try to make the biggest fights happen and the best fights happen. With the Lomachenko situation, that was another guy who was offered the most money he would’ve ever made in his entire career to fight me — he said no. With the Frank Martin situation, he was offered the most money that he would ever make in his career to fight me — he said no. So, honestly, it’s very frustrating trying to get these guys in the ring to fight me.”

On what he thinks it’s going to take to finally get his marquee fight

“I don’t know. That’s out of my power. I can only control what I can control, and what’s in my control is staying focused, staying in the gym, staying in shape and being ready for whenever the time comes.

“I don’t know what I got to do to get these guys in the ring. Maybe I have to go out there and have a bad performance. I probably got to go have a close fight with somebody andthen maybe somebody will get into the ring with me.”

On his beef with Devin Haney and wanting to fight him

“I want the fight. I’m the guy who went in the ring. I’m the guy who went to him, I’m the guy who started the chaos. I want the fight, I want the drama, I want the smoke. I’m with that. But at the end of the day he tried to lowball me, he tried to throw something out there that was nothing. It was pennies. My last three fights I made more than what he offered.

“So since I was offered less we went another route. We didn’t just say no to the fight. I went and made myself mandatory for the belt, and I expressed my mandatory position, and now you see me fighting for the WBC title that’s his. I’m fighting for his belt. So the world can put together what really happened.”",32 in 2016,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

As we near the September 30th fight date for Canelo Alvarez vs Jermell Charlo, Showtime has released its second full installment of All Access, highlighting behind the scenes footage of both fighters in training camp.

In this second episode training camp is in full swing as both fighters put in both the time to train hard, and invest in their recovery — all without feeling the need to neglect their family lives during this time. While many fighters move away for training camp to avoid distractions, both Canelo and Charlo take the opposite approach, keeping their loved ones close as a reminder of who they’re fighting for.

“They don’t understand the dedication that’s put in on a daily basis,” Charlo says. “We on the grind, we chilling with the family...this is a part of camp, this is a part of life...Sacrifice from your family and your girl and your kids, when you comfortable? Wake up.

“You telling me not to be here for my son because I got a fight coming up? This don’t get put on hold,” Charlo said about his children. “This gonna be everyday. This is my motivation, this is my inspiration.”

191,Title: Bob Arum says Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk still an easy fight to make,"Publication Date: 2023-09-18 00:00:00

Although there’s been plenty of banter and finger pointing from both sides, Top Rank promoter is still confident that an undisputed heavyweight title unification match between Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk is bound to happen.

Arum, speaking to Sky Sports, says he believes a fight between Fury and Usyk could take place next — after Fury faces Francis Ngannou — and goes so far as to say it’ll be an easy fight to make despite all the roadblocks we’ve encountered thus far.

“It won’t be hard to make,” Arum told Sky Sports. “I know the Usyk people, they’re nice people. His manager, his promoter, they’re terrific people. Usyk himself is a terrific guy. I think he wants that fight. I think that fight’s going to happen and hopefully it will happen sooner rather than later.”

Not only does Arum have faith in the Fury vs Usyk fight happening, he thinks it could come together sooner than most would believe.

“Probably early next year but it could happen as early as December,” he said.

Arum would continue by saying he doesn’t believe Fury has too many more fights left in him, and that after a presumed win over Usyk he may only take one or two fights more as a victory lap before hanging them up for good.

The optimism is good, but I’ll hold out for some real traction in negotiations before setting my hopes too high.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No

ESPN+, 5:00 am ET, Kenshiro Teraji vs Hekkie Budler. From Japan! Absolutely loving that ESPN+ have made Teraji fights a regular pick-up, and I like this fight, a unified titlist against a former two-division unified titlist who still has something in the bag, it seems. Junto Nakatani returns on the undercard, as does Tenshin Nasukawa, and I really dig the Anthony Olascuaga vs Giemel Magramo fight. Don’t know how much we’ll see on the ESPN+ stream, but I say skip work! Come watch some early morning fights! BLH will have live updates.

FITE+, 8:00 pm ET, BKFC 50: Lorenzo Hunt vs Chris Camozzi. Cruiserweight title fight! Hunt comes to bang, and he can bang. We’ll have a post at the very least. BLH will have live updates.

Saturday, Sept. 23

DAZN and Social Media, 12:30 pm ET, Misfits Boxing prelims.

ESPN+, 2:00 pm ET, Zhilei Zhang vs Joe Joyce 2. Five months ago, we said these big boys would get in there and get after it. They did not disappoint. I don’t expect them to come out and be dull this time, either. Zhang took the interim WBO title from Joyce in April, now Joyce wants it back. It is meaningful, because the winner is either in line for a fight with Oleksandr Usyk, or they’re in the position to be bumped to full title status if Usyk decides he’s done, which I think might be closer than some expect. Undercard is not exactly inspiring, if we’re being honest, but Queensberry have some good prospects lined up, plus Anthony Yarde is in action. BLH will have live updates.

DAZN, 2:00 pm ET, X Series 009: Virgo vs Chalmers. The Misfits main card. Idris Virgo is actually a professional boxer, though not a terribly serious one. As a “crossover” boxer, he’s quite serious, significantly better than most. Chalmers is a reality TV guy but also a legitimately trained fighter; again, not saying he’s some elite guy, but he has been trained for real, does know what he’s doing. You might recall him from a Mayweather exhibition this past January in London. All things considered this is a pretty good main event. Former KSI opponent FaZe Temperrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and some other people are also on this show. We won’t have live coverage because we’ve, frankly, got a serious professional boxing card to cover and not enough people to do both, but we will have some highlights up after this show is over.

DAZN, 8:00 pm ET, Richardson Hitchins vs Jose Zepeda. Think we’ve got a potential sleeper banger with this main event. Zepeda isn’t always exciting, but when he’s exciting, he’s very exciting. Hitchins has been aching to get a fight where, if he wins, he can be taken seriously as a contender at 140, and now he’s got it. Their styles could mesh nicely for some good action. The show also has Jessica McCaskill vs Sandy Ryan for three welterweight titles, plus Austin “Ammo” Williams vs Steve Rolls, and more. This is what you kinda hope to get for a “B-show” at the Caribe Royale in Orlando; I love this main event and like that women’s title fight a lot, too.

193,"Title: Ryan Garcia to return in November, says Oscar De La Hoya: ‘He’ll be back stronger, better, wiser’","Publication Date: 2023-09-16 00:00:00

Ryan Garcia’s return is still planned for November, according to promoter Oscar De La Hoya.

De La Hoya provided an update, though nothing concrete, during tonight’s Golden Boy show in Commerce, Calif., on DAZN.

“Ryan Garcia is coming up. We’re getting his date ready, mid-November, late-November,” the promoter said. “He’ll be back stronger, better, wiser than ever, and we’re looking forward to it.”

Garcia (23-1, 19 KO) is coming off of a KO-7 loss to Gervonta “Tank” Davis on Apr. 22 in Las Vegas, which was the biggest fight of the year to date, at least commercially.

The 25-year-old star has since ditched trainer Joe Goossen in favor of Derrick James, and has also had further spats with De La Hoya and Golden Boy, which is notable because Garcia and Golden Boy are in a constant situation where you have to refrain from getting too excited until something is fully confirmed.

But for now, it sounds like Ryan will be back in about two months. It’s also unlikely it’s going to be some huge, marquee sort of fight, given that timeframe and the fact that we don’t have an opponent named yet, plus Golden Boy’s in-house limitations for opposition.

Garcia will be fighting in the 140 lb division going forward.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
194,Title: William Zepeda demolishes Mercito Gesta in sixth round TKO: Full fight highlights and results,"Publication Date: 2023-09-17 00:00:00

William Zepeda was a buzzsaw tonight, totally overwhelming a brave but out-matched Mercito Gesta in their lightweight main event on DAZN.

Zepeda went to 29-0 (25 KO) with a one-sided TKO win, when Gesta’s corner called for the fight to be stopped at 1:31 of round six.

Zepeda, 27, was just relentlessly throwing at the 35-year-old Gesta (34-4-3, 17 KO) from the jump, and though Gesta did what he could to fire back — and did land some good shots — he just couldn’t put the frenetic pace or output of his opponent.

The win doesn’t necessarily tell us anything new about Zepeda, because he’s won and won well at this level already, but he did do basically everything possible to make whatever statement he could in this matchup.

“Thank you to Team Gesta, I wanted a fight with an experienced opponent and he gave that to me,” Zepeda said after the bout. “In the first round, I knew he was dangerous, and that I had to keep on working.”

“We want to fight all the champions, we want to fight who’s out there at 135. I think he’s ready for each and every one of them,” said trainer Jay “Panda” Najar. “As of right now, Devin Haney is the world champion, so we want to fight Devin Haney.”

Haney, of course, is moving up to 140 lbs in December to face Regis Prograis, so soon enough all four titles at 135 will be changing hands. At the moment, Gervonta “Tank” Davis is in position to simply be the actually recognized WBA titleholder (he has their secondary belt), while Shakur Stevenson will face Edwin De Los Santos for the vacant WBC belt in November.

That would leave the IBF and WBO titles, and those would be clear targets for Zepeda at 135.

Undercard

Victor Morales UD-10 Edwin Palomares (96-94, 99-91, 100-90): Well, one card here was alright, the other two too wide for my tastes. I had this 97-93 for Morales, but 100-90 is silly, there were a couple rounds Palomares clearly won, I think. Morales (19-0-1, 9 KO) didn’t have it easy in this one, not his best showing, but he bit down and got through it, too, and that’s important. Palomares (18-5-2, 9 KO) gave this all he had, but it wasn’t quite enough. Morales separated himself over the last four rounds, I thought. Pretty good fight, too!

It is getting spicy in the co-main event ️

Yokasta Valle UD-10 Maria Santizo (99-91, 99-91, 100-90): As “entertainment,” an honest review is this was pretty fun for a few rounds, and then all the rounds basically looked the same, and the energy petered out. But a win for Valle (29-2, 9 KO), who retains her IBF and WBO belts at 105 and hopes to make an undisputed clash with Seniesa Estrada, but we’ll see. Santizo (11-4, 6 KO) gave her usual honest effort but has one speed and it’s not enough to beat the better women she’s faced. Those are her four losses.

Darius Fulghum TKO-2 Ricardo Luna (1:30): Fulghum, a 27-year-old who’s working his way down to 168 lbs, only started boxing at all in 2015, and he’s an intriguing project-prospect for Golden Boy. There’s definitely a good bit to like with Fulghum (7-0, 7 KO); a lot to learn still and learning on the job, but a good bit to like. Luna (25-11-2, 16 KO) got cut on the side of the head and dropped in the second round, and his corner pretty much decided that was plenty. He’s a knockaround guy, gets fed to prospects, wouldn’t even really call him a gatekeeper, and he basically did what was expected here, however you wanna slice that.

Eric Priest MD-8 Simon Madsen (76-76, 79-73, 80-72): The MD part will look suspect, but no, the judges who had it for Priest had it right, I think. BLH unofficially scored it 79-73 for the 24-year-old Preist, who goes to 11-0 (7 KO), while Madsen drops to 13-2 (10 KO) with his second straight loss. Actually can kinda understand how a judge got to even. Do not agree at all, but this was a phone booth fight, competitive throughout, Madsen was never overwhelmed, and he was throwing a lot. Tim Bradley may want to contact his judging professors to explain to him how this could possibly have happened since, as he has recently learned at one (1) seminar where he was yelled at, all judges follow a strict code of ethics and guidelines, and have no personal preferences or biases whatsoever.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
195,"Title: Xander Zayas Scores Two Knockdowns, Stops Bloodied Roberto Valenzuela Jr. In 5th Round","Roberto Valenzuela Jr. was the supposed puncher entering his fight against Xander Zayas on Friday night.

It was Zayas, however, that proved to be too strong for the rugged Mexican veteran. The 21-year-old junior middleweight produced two first-round knockdowns, nearly another knockdown in the fourth round and bloodied Valenzuela’s nose to the point referee Mark Nelson stopped their scheduled 10-round, 154-pound bout in the fifth round.

Their co-feature on the Luis Alberto Lopez-Joet Gonzalez undercard was officially stopped 42 seconds into the fifth round at American Bank Center in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Zayas, a Puerto Rican fighter from Sunrise, Florida, improved to 17-0 and recorded his 11th knockout. Valenzuela (21-5, 20 KOs) lost by technical knockout for the second time in his six-year professional career.

A jarring jab by Zayas knocked Valenzuela backward about 20 seconds into the fifth round. Nelson halted the action after Zayas nailed him with a left uppercut about 20 seconds later.

A ringside physician took a close look at the cut across Valenzuela’s nose during the middle minute of the fourth round. He allowed the action to continue, but Nelson called for another break with 32 seconds to go in the fourth round.

The doctor again allowed Valenzuela to continue.

A right hand by Zayas buzzed Valenzuela soon thereafter, but Valenzuela held one of the ropes to keep from going down with just under 20 seconds on the clock in the fourth round.

A composed Zayas picked apart Valenzuela throughout the third round.

A sweeping left hook by Zayas landed with 1:20 to go in the third round. A cut opened on the bridge of Valenzuela’s nose earlier in the third round.

A stiff jab by Zayas made Valenzuela reset his feet with approximately 30 seconds to go in the second round. Zayas landed a counter left hook with about 1:15 on the clock in the second round.

Zayas scored two knockdowns during the first round.

The second knockdown was controversial because Zayas’ right hook knocked Valenzuela to the canvas with 52 seconds remaining in the opening round after their legs got tangled. Valenzuela was already falling to the canvas when Zayas hit him.

Valenzuela complained to Nelson once he reached his feet, but Nelson counted it as a knockdown.

A quick left hand by Zayas knocked Valenzuela to the canvas with 1:53 to go in the first round. A surprised Valenzuela answered Nelson’s count at seven and pawed at his nose once the action resumed.

196,Title: William Zepeda Believes Gervonta Davis Showdown Will Prove That He Belongs,"It’s been a natural progression for William Zepeda. From fighting in empty arenas on the non-televised portion of an undercard against fighters with no future, to headlining his own show against bonafide contenders, Zepeda’s career is moving in the right direction.

This Saturday night, at the Commerce Casino in California, that positive progression continues. On the night, he’ll look to unambiguously take care of business against Mercito Gesta.

Scoring a win over the 35-year-old isn’t likely to be on the front page of any newspapers. Coming up short, however, will push Zepeda to the back of the line. A flat and apathetic performance, nevertheless, isn’t what the 27-year-old is banking on. Not with the lightweight division jam-packed with popular names that can provide him with legacy-defining fights and enormous wads of cash. The one fighter who has the ability to do that better than just about anyone in the lightweight division by a mile is Gervonta Davis.

Far and wide, fans come out in droves to watch Davis fight. Zepeda, while skilled, doesn’t attract nearly that level of fanfare. Although it might be unlikely, the highly thought-of contender believes that a matchup against Davis would show the world that he belongs.

“That’s not only a good fight but that’s an excellent fight,” Zepeda told ESNEWS when asked about potentially fighting Davis down the line. “It’s a great opportunity for me to be able to prove why I’m here.”

As of late, Davis’ ears have perked up whenever his name is uttered. Ryan Garcia, his latest victim, can attest to that.

After years of calling him out, Davis banged his hand on the table and told Garcia to put his money where his mouth was. Once they officially met in the center of the ring earlier this year, Davis made him pay, beating him to the tune of a seventh-round stoppage.

Zepeda isn’t interested in trash-talking the Baltimore native. He also isn’t in the business of saying hold predictions. Instead, the Mexican native is more of the pragmatic type. Davis has a bevy of skills but his power is concussive, explosive, deadly, and whatever other violent superlatives you can think of. Zepeda isn’t oblivious to that. With that said, Davis won’t be in a sparring match if they squared off and will be forced to deal with what Zepeda brings to the table as well.

197,Title: ‘Nobody wants to fight’: Andy Ruiz Jr says he’s ready for Deontay Wilder or Anthony Joshua trilogy,"Publication Date: 2023-09-16 00:00:00

Andy Ruiz Jr hasn’t fought in just over a year now, after winning a narrow decision over Luis Ortiz in Sept. 2022, but says he’s training, staying in shape, and ready to fight.

“Everybody’s asking, ‘When am I fighting? When am I gonna fight? Why don’t I fight Wilder?’ Nobody wants to fight! I’m staying ready, baby!” he said in a post on Instagram.

“Tell Joshua, let’s do the trilogy! Tell Wilder I’m ready! Make me another contract! Usyk, Tyson Fury, everybody wants to go through the shortcuts, but I’m here, baby, we’re working.”

The 34-year-old Ruiz (35-2, 22 KO) and Wilder have been a topic of conversation this year, but neither side seemed all that interested, in all honesty, and a proposed WBC eliminator order never quite went through, meaning Tyson Fury remains free and clear for his big money, low-risk escapades against non-boxers.

More talk has been given to Wilder (43-2-1, 42 KO) and Joshua (26-3, 23 KO) finally meeting in a long overdue but still quite valuable heavyweight showdown in Saudi Arabia. Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has said he’s had multiple meetings with Saudi promoters about the bout, and there remains some hope it could happen by the end of 2023.

If it does, then Ruiz — who does look in good shape, to be serious about that — will have to find some other opponent if he wants to fight in 2023, but at this point it seems very realistic that he will not. He’s fought just twice since a frankly embarrassing performance in a rematch loss to Joshua in Dec. 2019.",2023-09-20,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
198,Title: Emanuel Navarrete vs Robson Conceicao added to Shakur Stevenson card in November,"Publication Date: 2023-09-15 00:00:00

Emanuel Navarrete will defend his WBO junior lightweight title on Nov. 16 against Robson Conceicao.

The fight will be on the undercard of Shakur Stevenson’s bout with Edwin De Los Santos for the vacant WBC lightweight title at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Navarrete (38-1, 31 KO) beat Liam Wilson to win the WBO 130 lb belt in February, the third weight class where the 28-year-old Mexican star has won a world title.

“El Vaquero” made a successful defense against former two-division titlist Oscar Valdez on Aug. 12.

Conceicao (17-2, 8 KO) will be getting his third chance to win this belt, previously dropping decisions to the aforementioned Valdez and the also-aforementioned Stevenson. His last four fights have been the loss to Valdez — which came with some controversy — then a win over Xavier Martinez, the loss to Stevenson, and a two-round no-contest on June 10 against Nicolas Polanco.

If you are wondering what he has done to merit another title shot, you have to remember that boxing title shots don’t really come from “merit.” Conceicao, 34, is with Top Rank and is ranked by the WBO. Well, actually, at the moment, he isn’t ranked by the WBO, but that can change very easily, and will.

So there is your answer. That is how it works.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
199,Title: Adrien Broner to return on November 4 on Don King card in Miami,"Publication Date: 2023-09-15 00:00:00

Adrien Broner will be back in the ring on Saturday, Nov. 4, headlining a Don King-promoted card in Miami at the same venue — Casino Miami Jai Alai — where he fought in June.

Broner, 34, had his first fight in over two years on June 6, beating Bill “Hutch” Hutchinson via 10-round decision at 147 lbs. This time around, he’ll face fellow Cincinnatian Chris Howard (18-2-1, 8 KO), a 34-year-old who has had one fight since 2016, which was a win at a Tennessee Embassy Suites on Jan. 13 of this year.

Howard did score a couple of decent wins in 2013 after losses in 2012 on smaller shows, then didn’t fight until once in 2016, and has only the one fight in the last seven years.

Broner (35-4-1, 24 KO) is sort of stuck here in terms of luring big opponents, because major promoters are a little wary about working with King, for starters, and about whether or not Broner will actually show up for his fight.

The only thing Broner can do to fix that is fight and show up consistently and hope to change peoples’ minds. The promoter part can be figured out, in all honesty. AB does still have some real name value out in the world.

So while this fight may not be any more exciting to you than Broner’s last one, it really is important that he simply fight and start proving himself reliable.

Also on the show:

Noel Mikaelian (26-2, 11 KO) will face Ilunga Junior Makabu (29-3, 25 KO) in a 12-round cruiserweight fight. The press release calls this a “WBC Cruiserweight Championship bout,” which it absolutely is not. Mikaelian does hold the “silver” title, so technically they’re not quite lying, entirely. But Badou Jack holds the title.

Jonathan Guidry (19-1-2, 11 KO) will take on Jesus Escalera (18-0, 18 KO) in a heavyweight fight.

Trevor Bryan (22-1, 15 KO) and Cassius Chaney (22-1, 15 KO) will put their identical records ON THE LINE in another heavyweight bout. Can they go to a draw or some type no-decision to keep the same record? We’ll see!

It’s a well-chosen date by King, as this is just about six weeks away and there’s nothing in prime time for U.S. boxing on Nov. 4. Most likely the fight will be a PPV that you can buy online from various outlets.",2023-09-19,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
200,Title: 'Don't Blame Tyson Fury.' WBC Head Says Heavyweight Titlist Is Not Responsible For Big Fights Falling Through,"Publication Date: 2023-09-14 20:06:47-04:00

By: Sean Crose

As he prepares to take on former UFC great Francis Ngannou in what will no doubt be a highly lucrative novelty fight, WBC and lineal heavyweight champion of the world Tyson Fury is getting a little help from a friend…Mauricio Sulaiman. The WBC boss isn’t helping Fury prepare for Ngannou. Rather, he’s helping the towering Englishman fend off some serious accusations. Fury was recently in negotiations to fight both WBA, WBO, and IBF heavyweight titlist Oleksandr Usyk, as well as former titlist Anthony Joshua. Yet each fight, for whatever reason, fell through. The undefeated Fury has subsequently been the target of much criticism for not facing top competition.

‘He is not fighting Oleksandr Usyk because he was not ready last December. Then they couldn’t do it in March and then they went their separate ways,” Suleiman said to Gambling.com, via the Daily Mail. “Anthony Joshua – the same thing, so don’t blame Tyson Fury. He has been there and been there ready.” With that being said, Sulaiman indicated he was quite excited about Fury’s upcoming battle with Ngannou in Saudi Arabia.

‘I love the event,” he said. “Those crossover events are giving the sport respect and doing it within the rules of boxing. Conor McGregor against Floyd Mayweather was a huge event and so will this (be). We are fine, respectful, and supporting our champion.” But couldn’t Fury face a mandatory contender instead of a boxing novice? “If you force the mandatory just for the sake of it,” said Sulaiman, “you are doing a disservice to the sport. We will not be rushing up a mandatory contender.”

Besides, Sulaiman argued, there’s no mandatory for Fury to face anyway. ‘We had ordered Wilder vs Ruiz and the winner would have been a sensational mandatory contender and that fight did not take place,” he said. “They are not participating in it so there is no mandatory contender. Fury is the best heavyweight without a doubt.” Again, Sulaiman wants it known that Fury longs for big fights. It’s just Fury hasn’t been allowed to land one lately. So says Sulaiman.

“Tyson Fury is the WBC heavyweight champion,” Sulaiman said. “He has been willing, able, and trying to fight Oleksandr Usyk, Anthony Joshua, Andy Ruiz Jr or anyone and has not been able to land the fight that the fans would like to see.” Fury and Ngannou will be squaring off on October 28th in Riyadh.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
201,Title: Sam Goodman vs Miguel Flores joins Tszyu vs Mendoza on October 15th,"Publication Date: 2023-09-14 00:00:00

Tim Tszyu’s October 15th clash with Brian Mendoza is a genuinely excellent scrap. Its co-feature is not. No Limit Boxing announced today that the show, hosted by Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, will see Sam Goodman face Miguel Flores at featherweight

This matchup is bizarre to the point of being inexplicable. Flores (25-4-1, 12 KO) is 1-2-1 in his last four, suffering back-to-back losses to Leo Santa Cruz and Eduardo Ramirez before beating 15-17-4 Diuhl Olguin and subsequently drawing with a returning Abner Mares. Goodman, on the other hand, built off his March rout of TJ Doheny with an impressive win over Ra’eese Aleem in an IBF eliminator.

It keeps Goodman (15-0, 7 KO) busy and he likely wants to keep his contender status safe while the Naoya Inoue-Marlon Tapales situation plays out, but it’s a complete nothing fight, especially when compared to the main event. Disappointing to say the least after Goodman turned in such a solid performance against Aleem. At least there’s the observational fascination of watching Flores parlay back-to-back knockout losses to Dat Nguyen and Chris Avalos into major opportunity after major opportunity.",2023-09-18,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
202,Title: Report: Shakur Stevenson vs. Edwin De Los Santos Set After Failed Frank Martin Fight,"Elsa/Getty Images

Shakur Stevenson and Edwin De Los Santos reportedly have agreed to fight on Nov. 16 in Las Vegas, according to ESPN's Mike Coppinger, with the vacant WBC lightweight title up for grabs.

The news follows Frank Martin pulling out of a scheduled matchup with Stevenson last week after an agreement had originally been reached.

""Shakur Stevenson is willing to fight anybody in and around his weight class,"" Top Rank spokesperson Evan Korn told Coppinger last week regarding Martin's withdraw. ""The fact that so many fighters have turned down the challenge is a testament to his greatness. It's disappointing that the fans will be deprived of such a highly anticipated matchup.""

Stevenson expressed a similar sentiment.

""Most ducked fighter in the sport of boxing,"" he wrote on Instagram, per Coppinger. ""Edwin get ready, I'm tired of [you] saying my name.""

Stevenson (20-0) is fast becoming one of the sport's most intriguing stars, with 10 knockouts to his name. Martin (18-0, 12 knockouts) is similarly a rising name in the sport.

Instead, the 26-year-old Stevenson will face De Los Santos. The 23-year-old isn't without a blemish in his young career, going 16-1, but 14 of his wins have come via knockout. His lone loss came against William Foster in Jan. 2022.

203,Title: Inactive Fighters Are Now Facing The Consequences Of Their Career Choices,"Publication Date: 2023-09-13 15:57:07-04:00

By: Sean Crose

First things first – this piece most distinctly does NOT pertain to fighters who have been largely inactive due to matters beyond their control. There are such fighters out there, after all…but not that many. The truth is that Keith Thurman, Danny Garcia, Andy Ruiz, Deontay Wilder and yes, Tyson Fury, are not – or haven’t been – facing solid competition as frequently as they should. And honestly? At least a few of them may have valid excuses for nor doing so. Not all of them do, though. Everyone knows that. Everyone is also becoming aware of the fact that these individuals risk fading from prominence….if they haven’t faded already.

Terence Crawford, the undisputed welterweight champion of the world, who has certainly NOT been inactive, recently unloaded on Thurman and Garcia via twitter. “@DannySwift you @keithfthurmanjr will never and I mean never get a shot at the top dog and that’s me,” he tweeted. “Y’all hoe assess didn’t want no smoke when I wanted to fight member. Now y’all want to fight so bad go keep fighting each other like b4.” The post may be bitter and vulgar but it clearly indicates that Crawford wants to separate himself from the likes of Garcia, who has fought five times in the past five years, and Thurman, who has fought three times in the last five years.

Not that Thurman and Garcia aren’t – or weren’t – excellent fighters with impressive resumes. They are/were. They’re just semi-retired, part time boxers. Will either man ever fight again? They themselves might not even know…but they’re far from the only examples of inactivity. Former WBA, IBF, and WBO heavyweight titlist Ruiz hasn’t fought in a year. Former WBC heavyweight champion Wilder hasn’t fought since last November, while current WBC heavyweight champion Fury, who hasn’t fought since last December, has opted to have a novelty bout this fall with UFC great Francis Ngannou rather than face a top contender.

What’s more, Fury has reportedly indicated that he no longer has interest in facing high level competition. Part of the reason is undoubtedly that the money from novelty fights is simply too good. Now, Fury is known to shoot off his mouth, so no one can really know when he’s serious and when he’s just blowing smoke. The truth, though, is that Fury’s attitude (if it truly is his attitude) is indicative of a bigger longtime problem in boxing. “I’m rich bro,” Garcia responded to Crawford’s posts. “i don’t need to fight you. i been making millions. Plus i ain’t tryna pay all those sanction fees. I can use some of that money to buy more real estate.” Although Garcia may have been stinging from Crawford’s initial comments, his words are indicative of a shallowness which has permeated through the sport of boxing for the last decade or so.

Garcia, however, isn’t a major player anymore. And Thurman arguably isn’t, either. Ruiz, Wilder, and Fury may soon find themselves marginalized, as well. If glory counts for nothing among some fighters, then so be it – but memories of their skills will someday fade as quickly as ice on a hot sidewalk. And it will all be on them. In the meantime, a new breed of notable fighters are working their way through the ranks. Tick-tock.",2023-09-17,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
204,"Title: ‘He never believed in my skills, but he’s gonna find out soon’: Canelo on Jermell Charlo calling him out for years","Publication Date: 2023-09-13 00:00:00

We’re just over two weeks away from the big fight between Canelo Alvarez and Jermell Charlo, and Canelo says he’s feeling 100 percent with his previously-injured hand, and that he has not forgotten the times Charlo called him out over the years.

Canelo (59-2-2, 39 KO) will be defending his undisputed super middleweight championship against Charlo (35-1-1, 19 KO) in the Showtime pay-per-view main event.

“I always want to make the best fights out there. I’m excited to be in this fight,” Canelo said at a media workout. “This is a fight that people have talked about for a while. I’m excited to show the Charlos my skills. Now Jermell is gonna feel my skills.

“I think Jermell Charlo is the perfect fight right now. He’s been calling me out for a long time and I never forget. He’s said a lot of things. He never believed in my skills, but he’s gonna find out soon. Him and his brother didn’t believe in my skills and that motivates me for this fight.”

More from Canelo’s workout

“We always prepare 100 percent no matter where we are. It’s different being here. At the beginning, I couldn’t breathe very well. But right now, I feel great. I’ve found a place that’s made me happy and strong.

“Charlo will be good at 168 lbs. I’ve made that jump before so I know. I think that when you’re a great champion like he is, it doesn’t matter.

“These kinds of fights motivate me. I like being underestimated. That’s what makes me excited for this fight.

“I always believe that I’m number one. My whole career. Because you need to believe in yourself. I still believe I’m number one. But I believe there is more than just one fighter alone at the top, there are a few.

“I still feel young and fresh. I never think about the end of my career. I just train and fight year after year. I still feel that I’m at my best.

“I’m very proud to represent Mexico. I have a lot of pride in my country. I feel amazing when I walk into the ring and see all the Mexican flags and hear the Mexican music. It feels great to represent my country.

“I feel great. This is really one of the best camps I’ve ever had. I feel great to be able to train 100 percent now with my left hand. That’s made me more confident. When you train knowing that you’re healthy, you’ll be more confident in the fight.

“I like being here in Lake Tahoe because I’m 100% focused. It’s just me and my team and we’re focused on the fight. It makes me feel ready for the fight.”

Eddy Reynoso, Canelo’s Manager and Trainer

“This is gonna be a great fight. Jermell is a great fighter who’s accomplished a lot in his career, so the fans are going to get an excellent matchup.

“There are times in a career where you have to change things up like training camp locations. We spent five or six years in San Diego and got a lot of great results. The altitude has been great for us here and we feel very good in Lake Tahoe as well.

“Canelo is ready to fight whoever it may be. Right now, we’re squarely focused on Jermell Charlo and that’s our task. We’ll be ready for whoever comes after that.”",2023-09-16,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
205,Title: B/R Exclusive: Tyson Fury Tells Critics 'Don't Watch' Fight vs. Francis Ngannou,"Justin Setterfield/Getty Images

Make no mistake: Tyson Fury hears it.

Loud and clear, in fact.

The consensus king of boxing's heavyweight division is quite aware that fans and media members are labeling his imminent in-ring engagement with ex-UFC heavyweight ruler Francis Ngannou as little more than a legalized bank heist in the Saudi desert.

Ngannou, after all, has never boxed professionally and was steered toward mixed martial arts after a would-be trainer in Paris suggested he'd never make a living in 10-ounce gloves. And his opponent, Fury, is an unbeaten champion who's handled each of the 30 men he's faced in a 15-year run.

So, no. The shade being thrown on the fight is no surprise for the Gypsy King.

He just doesn't care.

""If they don't like the idea, I don't give a f--k. Then don't watch it,"" Fury told Bleacher Report.

""I'm not trying to sell anybody anything. It'll be the two baddest mother f--kers on the planet meeting in the center of a ring and someone is going to get knocked spark out.

""To me, that's entertainment.""

Wiktor Szymanowicz/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

That's the calculation being made by the organizers of Riyadh Season, an annual festival launched in 2019 that falls during winter in the Saudi Arabian capital and has featured concerts, dining experiences and cultural events. This year's version kicks off October 28 with an opening ceremony and the fight, which is set for 10 rounds at a venue that's still to be announced.

Fury has never boxed in Saudi Arabia, but he did ""entertain"" at the inaugural Riyadh Season as part of the WWE's Crown Jewel event—defeating wrestler Braun Strowman in an eight-minute bout before taking a post-match body slam in the center of the ring.

The 10-point must system and a full slate of boxing rules will be in place this year against Ngannou, though it doesn't appear Fury's traditional WBC title will be at stake.

Instead, a trinket called the ""Riyadh Commemorative Belt"" has been commissioned, the 10-round distance is two off the typical championship limit for men's fights, and there are no references to the upcoming event on the sanctioning body's calendar.

No matter, Fury insists, he'll still be ready for full-fledged combat.

""I'm coming to take the guy's head off, and he'll be coming for mine. It's a fight,"" he said. ""I'm not out there to dance around for a bunch of rounds. I don't get paid extra for overtime.""

Al Bello/Getty Images

In fact, he's not gone 12 rounds in four fights since his first Saudi trip, stopping Deontay Wilder in seven to win the WBC title four months later and following up with defenses against Wilder, Dillian Whyte and Derek Chisora that have gone a combined 27 rounds.

Ngannou is no fan of long fights either, having ended all but one of his 17 MMA wins—12 by KO, four by submission—before the final horn. Eight of the KOs came in Round 1, with the others arriving in Round 2, and his power was termed by UFC boss Dana White as ""equal to getting hit by a Ford Escort going as fast as it can, and it's more powerful than a 12-pound sledgehammer from full-force overhead.""

Impressive stuff.

But if you're expecting Fury to genuflect, don't hold your breath waiting.

""Zero hesitation,"" he said. ""I walked right toward Wilder, took his best shots and knocked him out. I've knocked out the others, too. I'm ready to take [Ngannou's] shots.

""We'll see if he's ready to take mine.""

And guess what?

Assuming the latter answer is no, and Fury emerges with both consciousness and record intact, he isn't quite finished with an apparent quest to knock down traditional combat sports barriers.

Asked what fight he'd make if it could be done with a snap of the fingers, he had zero hesitation.

But it wasn't a unification with Oleksandr Usyk or a U.K. slugfest with fellow Brit Anthony Joshua.

""Jon Jones,"" Fury said, with no hint of sarcasm or kidding.

Yes. That Jon Jones.

PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images

The one with 11 title defenses across two reigns as the UFC's light heavyweight king before he left for three years, added more than 40 pounds and returned to pick up the vacant heavyweight belt that Ngannou left behind when his philosophical differences with White became irreconcilable.

The one atop the UFC's current pound-for-pound list.

And the one widely considered the best mixed martial artist in the sport's history.

But before you ask why, don't bother.

Fury's got his reasons.

""Why not?"" he said.

""After I take out the guy everyone says is the toughest out there, it makes sense that I'd go after the next guy, right? It's all about entertainment and giving the people what they want.

206,"Title: Keith Thurman Says He ""wipes"" Errol Spence That Fought Crawford","Publication Date: 2023-09-13 12:39:17-04:00

By Dan Ambrose: Keith ‘One Time’ Thurman diminished Terence ‘Bud’ Crawford’s recent career-best win over Errol Spence Jr. by saying that he would have wiped out that version of Errol on that night.

The way Spence (28-1, 22 KOs) looked that night, he likely would have lost to a number of top 15 welterweights and even 140-pounders.

It’s not just the performance against Crawford that suggests that Spence would lose to the likes of Thurman.

Spence’s previous fight against 35-year-old Yordenis Ugas last year already showed that something wasn’t right with him, and he wasn’t the same guy he’d been in the past.

Against Ugas, Spence looked like a classic example of a shot fighter, and the only reason he didn’t lose that fight is that the Cuban fighter isn’t an A-level guy.

What happened to Spence?

Was the two car accidents that Spence was in or a combination of being drained and worn out from his wars with Shawn Porter and Danny Garcia?

Errol went from being at the top of the world in 2018 to the faded, depleted, slow, easy-to-hit ham & eager that we saw struggle against Danny, Ugas, and Porter and then lose badly to Crawford.

“You didn’t beat up a real champion. I don’t think that version of Errol Spence would beat Shawn Porter,” said Keith Thurman to Fight Hub TV about Terence Crawford beating a depleted version of Errol Spence Jr. last July.

“Everybody knows Keith Thurman wipes that Spence. He gets wiped by many people,” said old ‘One Time’ Thurman, talking in the third person, sounding narcissistic in doing so.

That’s not taking anything away from Crawford (40-0, 31 KOs) because he did what he was supposed to do by defeating Spence by a ninth round knockout. But if you’re being honest, Spence would have lost to all of these fighters last July:

Jaron ‘Boots’ Ennis

Keith Thurman

Vergil Ortiz Jr.

Eimantas Stanionis

Subriel Matias

Gary Antuanne Russell

Teofimo Lopez

Regis Prograis

Devin Haney

Shakhram Giyasov

Roiman Villa

Rashidi Ellis

David Avanesyan

Egidijus Kavaliauskas

Shawn Porter

Arnold Barboza Jr.

Jose Ramirez

Spence will likely continue on after he loses his rematch with Crawford in December or early 2024, but once Errol gets beaten once or twice at 154 by some of the top 10 contenders, he’ll likely retire.

It would be easier for boxing fans to believe the former WBA & WBC welterweight champion Thurman (30-1, 22 KOs) if he wasn’t so old & inactive with his career.

207,Title: Subriel Matias vs Shohjahon Ergashev set for November 4th in Las Vegas,"Publication Date: 2023-09-13 00:00:00

Though PBC has yet to officially announce the bout, yesterday saw Julius Julianis confirm an earlier report from Jake Donovan that Subriel Matias will defend his IBF super lightweight title on November 4th against mandatory challenger Shohjahon Ergashev.

TGB Promotions won last month’s purse bid with a $510,000 offer and will stage the fight somewhere in Las Vegas

As I’ve said before, Matias (19-1, 19 KO) vs. Ergashev (23-0, 20 KO) is as tantalizing an action fight as you’re likely to see, a genuine slugfest in the making between one of boxing’s most entertaining champions and a long-avoided contender finally getting his opportunity. Sign me the hell up.

There’s a bit of new news, however, as McWilliams Arroyo (21-4, 16 KO) revealed that he’ll once again attempt to rematch Julio Cesar Martinez (20-2, 15 KO) in the co-feature. This is, without exaggeration, the most cursed matchup in boxing. It’s fallen apart four times, thrice because of Martinez and once because of Arroyo, and they only got to share the ring for six minutes in 2021 before a headbutt called things off.",2023-09-15,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
208,Title: ‘You didn’t beat up a real champion’: Keith Thurman responds to taunts from Terence Crawford,"Publication Date: 2023-09-13 00:00:00

Keith Thurman quickly caught wind of Terence Crawford’s series of social media posts taking aim at him, and then spent some time talking to Marcos Villegas of Fight Hub TV about his reaction to what Crawford had to say. Check out some of what Thurman had to say below.

Thurman on Crawford saying he’s just mad he’s the top dog now

“Yeah man, ain’t mad about it, bro. I don’t know if Danny (Garcia) said anything to spark that. There’s a few things. One, you didn’t beat up a champion, bro. I don’t think that Errol Spence would beat Shawn Porter, okay. God bless you, kid. You’re blessed. Everybody knows in boxing that it’s timing.

“I don’t really like to talk really down on fighters and take away — I hate people who just treat people like ‘oh this guy’s washed up now, blah blah blah.’ There’s a lot of stuff being said about me and my career. But, you know, there’s an old saying that Ben Getty used to talk about... the old saying is ‘one day you got it, and the next day you don’t.’ This is just for athletes in general. This happens, it’s one ofthose phenomenas that occur in sports — not just boxing, but sports.

“I haven’t really witnessed it much in my career, but for the first time ever when Errol Spence did his last performance I think we all saw it, man. What you are today is not the fighter that you were yesterday. And I don’t think it’s his fault, I think injuries and life caught up to the kid.

“There’s two things about you talking about me, Bud. There’s two things. Thing number one, the year that they wanted me to fight you was the year I was supposed to fight Pacquiao and everybody knew why I didn’t fight you. On your end, if they didn’t relay the message they say ‘hey, we’re not mad at you, we’re offering you this much for Crawford, they’re offering you that much for Pacquiao, I mean, the fact that you’re gonna take Pacquiao, it is what it is.’

“Now after the Barrios fight I was all ready to fight you. You was the one who just doesn’t want somebody to have a tune-up, shake off the dust, keep everything moving. You a stay-busy fighter, what do you got, 40 wins? I got ten less fights than you, homie. We come from the same Olympic year, bro. So I could’ve fought you any day of the week after February last year.

“We could’ve fought in July, August, September, October, period. And you did fight in October. You fought some nobody that we didn’t care about. So look, man. I’m not mad at him...has things been political when he was over there with Bob? Yeah. Are you king of the hill now? Yeah. Do you deserve it? Yeah. Do I still think you beat up almost nobody? You know, you didn’t beat up a real champion, kid.

“Everybody knows you put Thurman in the ring on that same night, Thurman wipes Spence — that Spence, that Errol, gets wiped by many people. And then you put me in there with you, kid, on that same night in Vegas, bro, it ain’t the same fight.”",2023-09-15,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
209,"Title: Shakur Stevenson Lashes Out at Frank Martin, Believes He Ducked Showdown","Shakur Stevenson proudly held his WBO and WBC titles. It was a culmination built on hard work and the old-fashioned phrase, blood, sweat, and tears.

It seemed like the super featherweight division would have to deal with Stevenson for the foreseeable future. But, just when he was getting comfortable, poof, it was over.

Stevenson’s time at 130 pounds wasn’t truncated at the hands of a contender or even a fellow champion. Instead, cutting down in weight became unbearable. So, when given new life, Stevenson felt like a new man once he officially moved up. But while a lopsided win over Shuichiro Yoshino proved that he was able to perform at his best in his new division, Stevenson has run into bigger problems.

All that the former Olympic silver medalist wants is to lace up his gloves and face the best of the best. Unfortunately for him, the feeling isn’t exactly mutual.

After being turned down by Vasiliy Lomachenko, Isaac Cruz, and William Zepeda, Stevenson began running out of options. Just a few weeks ago, it appeared as though the 26-year-old would be forced to face an opponent that he wasn’t entirely motivated to take on. Frank Martin, however, was happy as could be once it was announced that the WBC sanctioning body would order a showdown between himself and Stevenson.

As reported by BoxingScene.com, the sides had reportedly agreed to virtually everything. The only temporary snag in their WBC vacant title fight was a date and location.

None of that mattered to Stevenson. He finally got one of the division’s top names to face him. But while Stevenson was happy as could be, his smile was wiped off his face.

For whatever reason, Martin removed himself from the equation, leaving Stevenson without a dance partner. Now, forced to start from scratch once again, Stevenson, while venting on his social media account, is wondering why Martin left him at the altar.

210,Title: Shakur Stevenson - Frank Martin Fight Proves To Be A No-Go.,"Publication Date: 2023-09-09 21:44:14-04:00

By: Sean Crose

It was nice while it lasted, the thought of hotshot lightweight Shakur Stevenson battling the impressive contender Frank Martin. Sadly, ESPN reported on Saturday that the Stevenson-Martin fight, which had been agreed to earlier this week, isn’t happening after all. If the reports are true, Martin ultimately decided to pass on squaring off against Newark native Stevenson. The reason for Martin’s turning away from the chance of a lifetime hasn’t been given, but if he truly is stepping away from a Stevenson fight, the man is doing his reputation no favors. Needless to say, the undefeated Stevenson is now looking for a new opponent to battle in November.

The 20-0 fighter also believes the 18-0 Martin is ducking him. The truth is that Martin isn’t the only one avoiding a fight with Stevenson. Both Isaac Cruz and former pound for pound ranked titlist Vasyl Lomachenko have reportedly passed on facing the 26 year old former Olympian. Fighters may have solid individual reasons for passing on a Stevenson fight, but at the moment no one can fault the argument that Stevenson is currently one of the more avoided practitioners in the fight game. That sort of thing tends to happen when one performs in the ring as well as Stevenson does.",2023-09-14,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
211,Title: Terence Crawford: 'Canelo Vs Crawford Is The Biggest Fight In Boxing',"Publication Date: 2023-09-09 20:55:33-04:00

By: Sean Crose

Talk about having confidence to burn. After soundly beating Errol Spence this past summer to become the undisputed welterweight champion of the world, Terence Crawford is entertaining the thought of moving up in weight to challenge himself against the one and only Canelo Alvarez. “Canelo vs Crawford is the biggest fight in boxing,” Crawford tweeted on Friday. “There’s no fighter out there that’s a bigger fight then us.” It’s hard to argue the man isn’t telling the truth. A Canelo-Crawford match would be an enormous affair for the sport. Crawford, who fights a full three divisions under Canelo’s super middleweight realm, would be going above and beyond any sane expectations for a fighter were he to get it on with Canelo in the ring.

Canelo vs Crawford is the biggest fight in boxing. There’s no fighter out there that’s a bigger fight then us. — Terence Crawford (@terencecrawford) September 8, 2023

Crawford is ambitious, however. He wanted that fight with Spence for a long time (Spence wanted it, as well). Now that he’s met and defeated Spence, Crawford doesn’t strike one as a man who will be content to sit back and rest on his laurels at this point in his career. The Omaha native may usually be a man of few words, but Crawford hasn’t given any indication that he wants to slow down. In fact, the man may well be at the zenith of his career. The win over Spence was so one sided, so completely masterful, that at this point in time it’s hard to deny Crawford his place in history.

Will the man end up crumbling under the weight of his own goals? He might, but then how could he be faulted if he does? Say Crawford does indeed square off with the naturally much bigger Canelo in the near future. What sane person would claim the Crawford’s been “exposed” should he happen to lose? Canelo himself is an all time great.

At the moment, of course, Crawford and Canelo have other things to occupy their minds. Canelo is going to be facing junior middleweight kingpin Jermell Charlo in a few weeks – no small thing – and Spence has activated the rematch clause in his contract with Crawford. That means Crawford will have to face Spence again, despite how one sided the first battle between the two men was. Such a passing of time can lead pipe dreams such as a Canelo-Crawford match to fade away. Yet it can also let the idea simmer until it reaches full boil and becomes a reality.",2023-09-13,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
212,Title: Amanda Serrano To Face Danila Ramos In Title Fight Scheduled For Twelve Three-Minute Rounds,"Publication Date: 2023-09-06 21:18:03-04:00

By: Sean Crose

For some time now fans have been complaining about women’s boxing having rounds that are only two minutes in length. Why, the argument has gone, aren’t women allowed to fight three minute rounds, as the men are? It appears things are about to change. For Jake Paul’s Most Valuable Promotions has announced that undisputed featherweight champion Amanda Serrano will defend her crown against Dania Ramos on the 27th of October – in a fight scheduled for twelve three minute rounds. The bout is set to go down at Orlando’s Caribe Royale Resort, and will be broadcast live on the DAZN streaming service.

“Danila Ramos may be my WBO mandatory challenger,” says Serrano, “but when we step in the ring, she will understand exactly why I am the undisputed featherweight champion.” To Serrano, however, this will be more than just a run of the mill title bout.

“But this fight is about more than some belts,” she says. “We have faced a long and hard battle, united as women, to achieve the same pay, respect, and recognition in boxing. Together, on Friday, October 27th, we will make history and prove to the world once again, how incredible women’s boxing is and that we are just as tough, dynamic, and capable as any man in the ring, if not more so. This is a fight for women everywhere to be treated the same as their male counterparts.”

Ramos, the mandatory contender for Serrano’s WBO title strap (all Serrano’s major titles will be on the line), is likewise thrilled at the opportunity presented before her. “Fighting Amanda Serrano,” she says, “for 12 three-minute rounds for a unified championship is set to break the barriers that we women have been looking to do for many years.” Like Serrano, Ramos sees the fight as history in the making.

“We will go down in history and in the books,” she says, “it will be a fight of two women warriors! I am preparing like never before for this fight and will proudly represent Brazil as we battle in Orlando, Florida and I look to bring all the belts home.”

Brazil’s Ramos won her crack at glory by besting Brenda Karen Carbajal a few weeks back in Argentina. Serrano, whose last fight was also in August, is fresh from defeating former titlist Heather Hardy in a battle that saw Serrano emerge victorious via unanimous decision.",2023-09-13,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
213,Title: Shakur Stevenson-Frank Martin Title Fight Reportedly Agreed To,"Publication Date: 2023-09-05 16:10:23-04:00

By: Sean Crose

Numerous outlets are reporting that undefeated dynamo Shakur Stevenson is set to fight another undefeated contender, Frank Martin, for the WBC lightweight title in a contest to be held later this year (ESPN is reporting November or December). Although not as well known as the 20-0 Stevenson, the 18-0 Martin isn’t seen as a walk through the park for the Newark, New Jersey native by any stretch of the imagination. The fight was on the verge of going to a purse bid, but a deal was reached in time. Suffice it to say, it looks as if the event will be aired live on ESPN, which will make it a nice cherry to put at the top of a very good year for the sport.

With Devin Haney now apparently on his way to entering the junior welterweight realm, the winner of Stevenson-Martin may well be considered the shining star of one of boxing’s top divisions. Stevenson is already considered by some to be one of the best, if not the single best, fighters in the world pound for pound. At just 26 years of age, the former Olympic medalist has already won world titles in several weight divisions. Stevenson’s last fight was a six round destruction of Shuichiro Yoshino in his hometown of Newark last spring.

As for Martin, this is clearly the chance of a lifetime. Not that the 28 year old Detroit native hasn’t earned it. The man is relentless in the ring, can throw in combinations, can launch a punishing body attack – and can take punishment himself, as was seen in his gutsy victory over Artem Harutyunyan back in July. Only six of Martin’s opponent’s have made it to the final bell. In short, he’s a worthy opponent for Stevenson, as the pairing – on paper, at least – has the makings of a high quality, perhaps even thrilling, lightweight matchup.

Haney, who looks to be leaving the division behind, has been named the WBC’s champion in recess since he won’t be defending his title. The other big name in this saga is former lightweight kingpin, and pound for pound ranked fighter, Vasyl Lomachenko, who reportedly opted out of facing Stevenson, leaving the door open for Martin in the process. ESPN is indicating the Stevenson-Martin fight might be held in either Las Vegas or New York City, depending on the exact date it is set to go down.",2023-09-13,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
214,"Title: “It’s Slow, I Won’t Lie,” Eddie Hearn Talks Anthony Joshua-Deontay Wilder Negotiations","Publication Date: 2023-09-07 15:38:33-04:00

By: Sean Crose

Those looking to see a heavyweight throwdown between former supersize champions Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder might not want to hold their breath. Although the idea of the two heavy hitters getting it on in the ring is certainly appealing to fans, there’s no escaping the fact that modern boxing can be a bureaucratic spider web. Sure, 2023 has been a banner year for the sport – one well worth celebrating, no doubt – but major bouts remain challenging to make. And Joshua-Wilder is nothing if not a major bout. “It’s slow,” Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn told DAZN of the ongoing talks. “I won’t lie.”

Still, the Matchroom honcho came across as remaining relatively confident. “Obviously it’s a massive fight and these things take time,” said Hearn. “Everything is kind of agreed other than the signing of the paperwork. We know that takes time, especially in that part of the world.” By that part of the world, Hearn was referring to Saudi Arabia, where the fight would – at least as things stand – likely take place. Hearn may be patient, but he also made it clear that Joshua wants back in the ring sooner rather than later.

“For me the biggest concern,” Hearn said, “is AJ wants to fight in December or January, we know the Wilder fight is not going to happen in December so we’re happy to wait until January, but if that fight starts pushing back to February or March, don’t be surprised if he still signs for that fight but has another one in between. He’s loving the activity at the moment.

The heavyweight division is, sadly, a mess at the present time. With Oleksandr Usyk holding three of the four major titles, the desire for an undisputed heavyweight champion is great. Yet WBC and lineal titlist Tyson Fury is currently set to battle former UFC heavyweight kingpin Francis Ngannou. Suffice it to say Ngannou has never fought in a professional boxing match before. As the old saying goes, money talks, and Fury-Ngannou will no doubt bring in quite a bit of money. Joshua however, aims to keep moving forward.

“He’s loving being in training camp,” said Hearn. “He’s loving working with Derrick James. But our full focus is to sign the Deontay Wilder fight. I’m not disappointed but we want to get it done. The conversations have to extend to Usyk and Fury, they could be on the same card – who knows? So there’s a lot of conversations to be had. I truly believe that Wilder is up for and ready for this fight. We’re in a good place.”",2023-09-13,ESPN,https://bleacherreport.com/,tennis,No
